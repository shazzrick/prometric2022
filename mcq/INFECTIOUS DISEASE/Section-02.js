                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Correct!</p><p>Correct answer is C : Botulism poisoning<br/>Botulism is a condition caused by a toxin released by an anaerobic bacteria Clostridium botulinum. The bacteria are notorious for contaminating tinned meats and cause food poisoning following its consumption. The food poisoning is caused by the release of the botulinumtoxin.The toxin paralyses the nerve endings by blocking the nerve impulses at the myoneural junction by inhibiting the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This results is in weakness and ultimately paralysis of the muscles.The incubation period is of about 12-30hrs before the toxin gets absorbed completely and causes various manifestations. the onset of symptoms occurs with nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting. This is followed characteristically by paralysis of the extra and intraocular muscles. These muscles being smaller get affected earlier than other skeletal muscles. The paralysis of the ocular muscles manifests as blurring of vision (due to loss of accommodation) and double vision(diplopia) due to paralysis of extra-ocular muscles. These symptoms are followed by generalized muscle weakness. Poisoning by E.coli is not the correct answer. E.coli poisoning can cause vomiting and abdominal pain but it is usually associated with diahorrea or dysentery. Also E.coli poisoning never manifests with ocular symptoms and generalized muscle weakness.Vibrio cholera is a diahorreal disease which characteristically has rice water stools. It never shows any ocular involvement or muscle weakness. The patient at the time of presentation is severely dehydrated.Salmonellatyphi does not cause acute food poisoning..</p>"

He notes that he also has other complaints aside from his lung problems, including sharp, intermittent chest pain and joint pain in his elbows and knees. There is also a rash on both lower extremities that is erythematous and features raised lesions; it is determined to be erythema nodosum. Cardiac examination reveals a friction rub and a CT scan of the chest reveals cavitation of both lung apices. The patient is isolated under suspicion of an active tuberculosis infection. A PPD test is negative. Sputum sample staining fails to reveal acid-fast bacilli, but does reveal yeast forms that are replicating by narrow-based budding.

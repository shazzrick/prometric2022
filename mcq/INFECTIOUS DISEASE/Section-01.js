Fewer than 200 babies with HIV are born each year in the United States.<br />\n- For 6 weeks after birth, babies born to women with HIV receive an HIV medicine called zidovudine(brand name: Retrovir). The HIV medicine protects the babies from infection with any HIV that passed from mother to child during childbirth.<br />\n- HIV testing for babies born to women with HIV is recommended at 14 to 21 days after birth, at 1 to 2 months, and again at 4 to 6 months. The test used (called a virologic HIV test) looks directly for HIV in the blood.<br />\n- Results on two virologic tests must be negative to be certain that a baby is not infected with HIV. The first negative result must be from a test done when a baby is 1 month or older and the second result from a test done when a baby is 4 months or older. Results on two HIV virologic tests must be positive to know for certain that a baby is infected with HIV. <br />\n- If testing shows that a baby has HIV, the baby is switched from zidovudine to a combination of HIV medicines. HIV medicines help children infected with HIV live healthier lives. <br />\n- Because HIV can spread in breast milk, HIV-infected women in the United States should not breastfeed their babies. In the United States, infant formula is a safe and healthy alternative to breast milk.<br />\n<br />\nhttps://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/fact-sheets/24/71/preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv-after-birth.</p>"

Chronic hepatitis B infection lasts six months or longer. It lingers because your immune system can't fight off the infection.<br />\n<br />\nAcute vs. Chronic Hepatitis B<br />\nA hepatitis B infection can result in either an acute infection or a chronic infection. When a person is first infected with the hepatitis B virus, it is called an \"acute infection\" (or a new infection). Most healthy adults that are infected do not have any symptoms and are able to get rid of the virus without any problems. Some adults are unable to get rid of the virus after six months and they are diagnosed as having a \"chronic infection.\" A simple blood test can diagnose an acute or chronic hepatitis B infection.<br />\n<br />\nThe risk of developing a chronic hepatitis B infection is directly related to the age at which a person is first exposed to the hepatitis B virus. The younger a person is when they are first infected, the greater the risk of developing a chronic hepatitis B infection:<br />\n<br />\nMore than 90% of infants that are infected will develop a chronic hepatitis B infection<br />\nUp to 50% of young children between 1 and 5 years who are infected will develop a chronic hepatitis B infection<br />\n5-10% of healthy adults 19 years and older who are infected will develop a chronic hepatitis B infection (that is, 90% will recover from an exposure)<br />\nMost pregnant women do not know whether they are infected with hepatitis B and can unknowingly pass the virus to their newborns during childbirth. Therefore, since the risk of newborns becoming chronically infected at birth is so high, both the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that all infants receive the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 12-24 hours after birth.<br />\n<br />\nThe recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination of babies and children is so important because they are at greatest risk of developing a chronic infection if they are not protected against the hepatitis B virus as soon as possible. <br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hepb.org/what-is-hepatitis-b/what-is-hepb/acute-vs-chronic/\">https://www.hepb.org/what-is-hepatitis-b/what-is-hepb/acute-vs-chronic/</a>.</p>"

Control of the HIV infection will have the main role in the management of hematological manifestations of the virus.<br />\n<br />\nHighly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART)<br />\n<br />\nHighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are medications used to treat HIV infection. These medications may also be called antiretroviral drugs (ART), antiretrovirals (ARVs), or anti-HIV drugs. While there is currently no cure for HIV infection, the availability of HAART now means that HIV is no longer a fatal infection, but is a condition that can be managed through lifelong treatment. <br />\n<br />\nHAART prevents the HIV virus from making copies of itself and limits how much virus is in the body. The level of virus in the blood is called ‘viral load’. When the viral load is low, there is less harm to the body’s immune system and fewer complications of HIV infection. Reducing the viral load to \"undetectable\" levels also reduces the chance of passing HIV to partners. <br />\nThere are different kinds of HAART available for treatment. Today HAART is easy to take and the number of pills needed are less than in the past.<br />\nIn BC, HAART is free and is prescribed by doctors with an expertise in HIV. The doctor will decide what medications are best, and will arrange for the regular blood work that is needed to safely use HAART.<br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3259517/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3259517/</a>.</p>"

Control of the HIV infection will have the main role in the management of hematological manifestations of the virus.<br />\n<br />\nHighly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART)<br />\n<br />\nHighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are medications used to treat HIV infection. These medications may also be called antiretroviral drugs (ART), antiretrovirals (ARVs), or anti-HIV drugs. While there is currently no cure for HIV infection, the availability of HAART now means that HIV is no longer a fatal infection, but is a condition that can be managed through lifelong treatment. <br />\n<br />\nHAART prevents the HIV virus from making copies of itself and limits how much virus is in the body. The level of virus in the blood is called ‘viral load’. When the viral load is low, there is less harm to the body’s immune system and fewer complications of HIV infection. Reducing the viral load to \"undetectable\" levels also reduces the chance of passing HIV to partners. <br />\nThere are different kinds of HAART available for treatment. Today HAART is easy to take and the number of pills needed are less than in the past.<br />\nIn BC, HAART is free and is prescribed by doctors with an expertise in HIV. The doctor will decide what medications are best, and will arrange for the regular blood work that is needed to safely use HAART.<br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3259517/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3259517/</a>.</p>"

Passive immunization<br />\nHuman rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) or equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG) or F(ab’)2 products should be used for category III exposures as well as for some category II exposures (see table above). Passive immunization should be administered just before or shortly after administration of the first dose of vaccine given in the post-exposure prophylaxis regimen.

Any remainder should be injected i.m. at a site distant from the site of active vaccine administration. Multiple needle injections into the wound should be avoided.

Daily suppressive therapy can be prescribed for recurrent genital herpes. If the roofs come off the vesicles and the lesion becomes an ulcer of unclear etiology, then the best initial diagnostic test is a Tzanck prep. The most accurate test for herpes is PCR.

The hepatitis A virus is a picornovirus that is transmitted faeco-orally,<br />\nusually due to the ingestion of contaminated water. The virus replicates in the liver and is excreted in the bile and then the faeces of infected<br />\nindividuals. Following infection, the viraemia causes the prodromal symptoms of fever, malaise, anorexia and nausea. Subsequently, jaundice<br />\nmay develop. As this happens, the spleen or liver may be palpable. The history of travel, the friends being affected and the clinical features should<br />\nidentify hepatitis A as the correct answer in this case. Gilbert’s syndrome (D) is an inherited hyperbilirubinaemia that is completely asymptomatic<br />\nand is normally detected as an incidental finding of a raised bilirubin with other blood results within the normal parameters. While the affected<br />\nindividuals in this question are brothers, the jaundice has been acquired, making Gilbert’s syndrome the incorrect answer. Hepatitis B (B) is<br />\ntransmitted intravenously and is also sexually transmitted. In addition, it may also be transmitted vertically from mother to child. Clinical features<br />\nmay be similar to those seen in hepatitis A. In addition, extrahepatic features, such as rashes, arthralgia and glomerulonephritis, are more<br />\ncommon. The outbreak of disease among three travellers makes hepatitis A the more likely option in this question. Hepatitis C (C) is transmitted by the intravenous route and is sexually transmitted. Acute infection is usually asymptomatic or mild, making this answer incorrect for this<br />\nquestion. The majority of patients develop a chronic infection which predisposes to developing liver cirrhosis. The most common presenting<br />\nfeatures of malaria (E) are fevers, headache, vomiting or diarrhoea. While patients with malaria may develop jaundice and have a palpable liver, the absence of the other features of malaria, including pyrexia, make this answer incorrect..</p>"

The case described in this question is of cutaneous leishmaniaisis. In cutaneous leishmaniaisis, lesions develop at the bite site. These start as an itchy papule and develop into erythematous ulcers with raised edges. In visceral leishmaniasis, the protozoa spread from the cutaneous lesions, via the lymphatics to the reticuloendothelial system. Onset of symptoms may be insidious and features include fever, sweats, cough and arthralgia. The liver, spleen and lymph nodes are usually enlarged on physical examination. Mucocutaenous leishmaniasis occurs when primary cutaneous lesions spread to the mucosa of the nose, palate, pharynx or larynx. African typanosomiasis (B) is sleeping sickness and is caused by Trypanosoma gambiense. Herpes zoster (C) is shingles, which presents with a blistering rash across a well-demarcated dermatomal distribution.

Snail vectors release cercariae into the water where they can penetrate the skin or mucous<br />\nmembranes of humans. An itchy papular rash (known as a swimmer’s itch) may develop at the site of penetration. Once they have penetrated through the skin or the mucous membranes, the schistosomoules migrate to the liver. Approximately 3 weeks after infection, the host may develop fever, rash, myalgia, diarrhoea and there may be hepatosplenomegaly on examination (this reaction is termed Katayama fever). The flukes mature in the liver and then migrate to their final destination (either the mesenteric veins or the vesicular plexus). In their final positions, the flukes may result in a chronic infection with varying clinical features. Leishmaniasis (B) is a parasitic infection transmitted via sand flies. While<br />\ncutaneous leishmaniasis may present with skin signs and symptoms, the itchy papular rash seen in this case is not a feature. The fevers and palpable liver edge described in this case may be the initial features of visceral leishmaniasis, but onset tends be slower that what has been described in this case and take a longer time to be manifested from the initial infection. African trypanosomiasis (C) is sleeping sickness. Malaria might present with the fever, lethargy and myalgia described.

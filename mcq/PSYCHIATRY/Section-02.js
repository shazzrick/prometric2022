Hallucinations are vivid, substantial, and are perceived to be located in external objective space. They are distinguishable from several related phenomena, such as dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness; pseudohallucination, which does not mimic real perception, and is accurately perceived as unreal; illusion, which involves distorted or misinterpreted real perception; and imagery (imagination), which does not mimic real perception and is under voluntary control.[1] Hallucinations also differ from \"delusional perceptions\", in which a correctly sensed and interpreted stimulus (i.e., a real perception) is given some additional (and typically absurd) significance.<br />\n<br />\nHallucinations can occur in any sensory modality—visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, proprioceptive, equilibrioceptive, nociceptive, thermoceptive and chronoceptive.<br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination</a>.</p>"

The combination of MAO inhibitors and these drugs can cause an acute hypertensive episode.<br />\n<br />\nMonoamine oxidase also breaks down tyramine, a chemical present in aged cheese, wines, and other aged foods. Since MAOIs inhibit monoamine oxidase, they decrease the breakdown of tyramine from ingested food, thus increasing the level of tyramine in the body. Excessive tyramine can elevate blood pressure and cause a hypertensive crisis. Patients treated with MAOIs should adhere to recommended dietary modifications that reduce the intake of tyramine.<br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.medicinenet.com/mao_inhibitors-oral/article.htm#are_maois_safe_to_take_if_im_pregnant_or_breastfeeding\">https://www.medicinenet.com/mao_inhibitors-oral/article.htm#are_maois_safe_to_take_if_im_pregnant_or_breastfeeding</a>.</p>"

The combination of MAO inhibitors and these drugs can cause an acute hypertensive episode.<br />\n<br />\nMonoamine oxidase also breaks down tyramine, a chemical present in aged cheese, wines, and other aged foods. Since MAOIs inhibit monoamine oxidase, they decrease the breakdown of tyramine from ingested food, thus increasing the level of tyramine in the body. Excessive tyramine can elevate blood pressure and cause a hypertensive crisis. Patients treated with MAOIs should adhere to recommended dietary modifications that reduce the intake of tyramine.<br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.medicinenet.com/mao_inhibitors-oral/article.htm#are_maois_safe_to_take_if_im_pregnant_or_breastfeeding\">https://www.medicinenet.com/mao_inhibitors-oral/article.htm#are_maois_safe_to_take_if_im_pregnant_or_breastfeeding</a>.</p>"

She describes that during the episodes, she feels as if she will go crazy or will die and experiences an urge to escape. The episodes occur suddenly without a known trigger and usually last for 20–30 minutes. To date, she has experienced six episodes, and she has now developed a fear about having another episode. There is no history of substance use. On physical examination, her vital signs are stable, and general and systemic examinations reveal no significant abnormality. Her mental status examination rules out symptoms such as low mood, mood changes, loss of interest, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, and apathy. The physician also rules out medical conditions by ordering appropriate investigations. The patient is at an increased risk of which condition?</p>"

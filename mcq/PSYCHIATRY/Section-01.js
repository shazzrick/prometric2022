If the question describes persistent worry of a panic attack or social encounter, then GAD is not the answer. In GAD, multiple life circumstances, not just one, are causing the anxiety.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">Panic attack</strong> is a rush of intense psychological and physical symptoms. These symptoms of panic can be frightening and happen suddenly, often for no clear reason.....Panic attacks usually last <span style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">between five and 20 minutes</span>, and although it may feel as though you are in serious trouble, they aren't dangerous and shouldn't cause any physical harm. It is unlikely you will be admitted to the hospital if you have a panic attack. You may feel an overwhelming sense of fear and a sense of unreality as if you’re detached from the world around you. As well as psychological symptoms, you may also experience physical symptoms of panic, such as: a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly<span style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\"> (palpitations)</span> <span style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">sweating, trembling, shortness of breath (hyperventilation) a choking sensation chest pain feeling sick </span>The physical symptoms of a panic attack are caused by your body going into \"fight or flight\" mode in response to something you think is a threat.

SSRIs are the treatment of choice for patients with CAD since they are comparatively safe.109 This class of medications includes fluoxetine (Prozac®), sertraline (Zoloft®), paroxetine (Paxil®), fluvoxamine (Luvox®), citalopram (Celexa®) and escitalopram (Lexapro®).<br />\nSSRIs selectively inhibit serotonin reuptake by the presynaptic neurons, thus increasing serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft. There are case reports of SSRIs causing arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation and flutter, heart block, bradycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia.110–114 SSRIs, in general, are thought be cardio safe. Several small studies and some major studies like SAD HART and CREATE provided data regarding the safety of SSRIs in patients with CAD.95,115–11<br />\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2719442/.</p>"

GAD is a common disorder of which the central feature is excessive worry about a number of different events. Key symptoms include excessive anxiety about multiple events and issues, and difficulty controlling worrisome thoughts that persists for at least 6 months.<br />\n<br />\nAntidepressants provide a modest-to-moderate reduction in anxiety in GAD,[22] and are superior to placebo in treating GAD. The efficacy of different antidepressants is similar.[2<br />\n<br />\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of drugs that are typically used as antidepressants in the treatment of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.<br />\n<br />\nSSRIs function by increasing the extracellular level of the neurotransmitter serotonin by limiting its reabsorption (reuptake) into the presynaptic cell, increasing the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft available to bind to the postsynaptic receptor.They have varying degrees of selectivity for the other monoamine transporters, with pure SSRIs having only weak affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters.<br />\n<br />\nSSRIs are the most widely prescribed antidepressants in many countries.The efficacy of SSRIs in mild or moderate cases of depression has been disputedand may be outweighed by side effects<br />\n<br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor#Social_anxiety_disorder\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor#Social_anxiety_disorder</a>.</p>"

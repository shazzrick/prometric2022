Prevention is the most important treatment: (1) All > 40y/a should have eye exam per 3-5years; (2) Patients with risks need annual exam. <br />\n2. Topical medications: In most cases, IOP can be controlled by a topical beta-R blocker (timolol or betaxolol eyedrop, to decrease aqueous humor production), or pilocarpine (to increase aqueous outflow). If failed, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide) is used. <br />\n3. If all medicines fail, laser trabeculoplasty is performed to improve aqueous drainage..</p>"

It presents with the following:<br />\n-Fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, weakness with hypotension <br />\n-Thin patient with hyperpigmented skin<br />\nDiagnostic Testing <br />\nLaboratory abnormalities are as follows:<br />\n-Hyperkalemia with a mild metabolic acidosis from the inability to excrete either H+ or K+ because of the loss of aldosterone. <br />\n-Hyponatremia <br />\n-May have hypoglycemia and neutropenia: Glucocorticoids increase glucose and white cell levels.<br />\n<br />\nThe most accurate diagnostic tests are these<br />\n-Cosyntropin (synthetic ACTH) stimulation test: You measure the level of cortisol before and after the administration of cosyntropin. If there is adrenal insufficiency, there will be no rise in cortisol level. <br />\n-CT scan of the adrenal gland<br />\n<br />\nTreatment<br />\n-Steroid replacement: For acute addisonian (hypoadrenal) crisis, draw a cortisol level and give fluids and hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone provides both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity. <br />\n-Prednisone: Stable (nonhypotensive) patients are treated with prednisone. Fludrocortisone is the steroid highest in mineralocorticoid content. <br />\n-Fludrocortisone is used for patients with adrenal insufficiency who are still hypotensive after initial replacement with prednisone. If renin levels are elevated, you would also add fludrocortisone.</p>"

This includes ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and wide complex tachycardia, as well as atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.[1] Evidence in cardiac arrest, however, is poor.[2] It can be given by mouth, intravenously, or intraosseously.[1] When used by mouth, it can take a few weeks for effects to begin.<br />\nCommon side effects include feeling tired, tremor, nausea, and constipation.[1] As amiodarone can have serious side effects, it is mainly recommended only for significant ventricular arrhythmias.[1] Serious side effects include lung toxicity such as interstitial pneumonitis, liver problems, heart arrhythmias, vision problems, thyroid problems, and death.[1] If taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding it can cause problems in the baby.[1] It is a class III antiarrhythmic medication.[1] It works partly by increasing the time before a heart cell can contract again..</p>"

This includes ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and wide complex tachycardia, as well as atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.[1] Evidence in cardiac arrest, however, is poor.[2] It can be given by mouth, intravenously, or intraosseously.[1] When used by mouth, it can take a few weeks for effects to begin.<br />\nCommon side effects include feeling tired, tremor, nausea, and constipation.[1] As amiodarone can have serious side effects, it is mainly recommended only for significant ventricular arrhythmias.[1] Serious side effects include lung toxicity such as interstitial pneumonitis, liver problems, heart arrhythmias, vision problems, thyroid problems, and death.[1] If taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding it can cause problems in the baby.[1] It is a class III antiarrhythmic medication.[1] It works partly by increasing the time before a heart cell can contract again..</p>"

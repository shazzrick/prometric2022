This condition is also called rapid gastric emptying. It is mostly associated with conditions following gastric or esophageal surgery, though it can also arise secondary to diabetes or to the use of certain medications; it is caused by an absent or insufficiently functioning pyloric sphincter, the valve between the stomach and the duodenum.<br />\n<br />\nDumping syndrome has two forms, based on when symptoms occur. Early dumping syndrome occurs 10 to 30 minutes after a meal. It results from rapid movement of fluid into the intestine following a sudden addition of a large amount of food from the stomach.The small intestine expands rapidly due to the presence of hypertonic/hyperosmolar contents from the stomach, especially sweet foods. This causes symptoms due to the shift of fluid into the intestinal lumen, with plasma volume contraction and acute intestinal distention.Osmotic diarrhea, distension of the small bowel leading to crampy abdominal pain, and reduced blood volume can result.<br />\n<br />\nLate dumping syndrome occurs 2 to 3 hours after a meal. It results from excessive movement of sugar into the intestine, which raises the body's blood glucose level and causes the pancreas to increase its release of the hormone insulin.

Colectomy means ‘to remove the colon’, with ‘col-’ meaning colon and ‘-ectomy’ meaning to remove.    A colectomy can be performed as a partial or a total colectomy.  During a partial colectomy, only a portion of the colon is removed.  This may be performed if colon cancer is present, but has not spread to other areas of the colon.  This may also be done after a traumatic injury to the colon, like a tear in the colon after a car accident.  A total colectomy is just like a partial colectomy, but the entire colon is removed instead of just a piece.  This procedure may be necessary if you have ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. After a colectomy, you may have a colostomy or ileostomy.  Both of these terms describe a procedure in which the end of the remaining colon is brought to the surface of the skin.  This allows gastrointestinal contents, like bile and waste, to leave the body through this hole.  A bag, called a colostomy or ileostomy pouch, is then attached to the skin to collect the waste.  The picture to the left shows a colostomy.  The only difference between a colostomy and an ileostomy is the location of the stoma (the opening).

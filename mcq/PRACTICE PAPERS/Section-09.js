As the blood accumulates, the surrounding muscle swells and forms fibrous tissue in response to the irritation. This swollen area within the uterine muscle wall, called an adenomyoma, feels very much like a fibroid on examination and is often confused with a fibroid on a sonogram.

There are other diseases associated with glomerular IgA deposits, the most common being Henoch-Schönleinpurpura (HSP), which is considered by many to be a systemic form of IgA nephropathy. HSP presents with a characteristic purpuric skin rash, arthritis, and abdominal pain and occurs more commonly in young adults (16-35 yrs old). HSP is associated with a more benign prognosis than IgA nephropathy. In IgA nephropathy there is a slow progression to chronic kidney failure in 25-30% of cases during a period of 20 years.<br />\nThe classic presentation (in 40-50% of the cases) is episodic hematuria which usually starts within a day or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (hence synpharyngitic) as opposed to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis which occurs some time (weeks) after initial infection. Less commonly gastrointestinal or urinary infection can be the inciting agent. All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production. Groin pain can also occur. The gross hematuria resolves after a few days, though microscopic hematuria may persist. These episodes occur on an irregular basis every few months and in most patients eventually subsides (although it can take many years). Renal function usually remains normal, though rarely, acute kidney failure may occur (see below).

It should not be confused with sialadenosis (sialosis) which is a non-inflammatory enlargement of the major salivary glands.<br />\n<br />\nSialadenitis can be further classed as acute or chronic. Acute sialadenitis is an acute inflammation of a salivary gland which may present itself as a red, painful swelling that is tender to touch. Chronic sialadenitis is typically less painful but presents as recurrent swellings, usually after meals, without redness.<br />\n<br />\nCauses of sialadenitis are varied, including bacterial (most commonly Staphylococcus aureus), viral and autoimmune conditions<br />\n<br />\nInfection<br />\nThe most common salivary gland infection is mumps. It is characterised by bilateral swelling of the parotid glands, however other major salivary glands may also be affected in around 10% of cases. The swelling persists for about a week, along with low grade fever and general malaise.<br />\nRecurrent parotitis of childhood is characterised by periods of pain and swelling in the parotid gland accompanied by a fever<br />\n<br />\nTreatment<br />\nIn chronic recurrent sialadenitis or chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, acute attacks are managed with conservative therapies such as hydration, analgesics (mainly NSAIDs), sialogogues to stimulate salivary secretion, and regular, gentle gland massage. If infection is present, appropriate cultures should be obtained, followed by empirical antibiotic therapy initially,for example amoxicillin/clavulanate or clindamycin which cover oral flora.<br />\n<br />\nIf there are attacks more than approximately 3 times per year or severe attacks, surgical excision of the affected gland should be considered.<br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialadenitis#Treatment\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialadenitis#Treatment</a>.</p>"

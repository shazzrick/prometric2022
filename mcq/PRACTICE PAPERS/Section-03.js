As such, nephrotic syndrome may be associated with a reduction in circulating antithrombin III and free protein S levels.<br />\n<br />\nAntithrombin III (ATIII) is a nonvitamin K-dependent protease that inhibits coagulation by neutralizing the enzymatic activity of thrombin (factors IIa, IXa, Xa).

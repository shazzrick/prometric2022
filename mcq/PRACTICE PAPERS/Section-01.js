Multiple acute infarctions can cause papilloedema to develop<br />\nand this also compounds the patient’s confused state. A lacunar infarction<br />\n(C) is often associated with hypertension and is often asymptomatic.<br />\nSymptomatic patients often exhibit the effects of minor strokes such as<br />\nabrupt dysarthria, pure sensory or motor loss. Papilloedema is not a<br />\ncommonly associated feature. Vascular dementia (D) can occur due to the<br />\naccumulation of several small lacunar infarctions or from a few large<br />\ninfarctions. Patients usually exhibit cerebral decline, pseudobulbar palsy<br />\nand abnormal gait. Papilloedema is again not a commonly associated<br />\nfeature. A subdural haemorrhage (A) can exhibit symptoms from days to<br />\nmonths depending on the degree and rapidity of bleeding which is often<br />\ntraceable to a precipitant such as a fall or blow to the head, which is not<br />\npresent in this case. Symptoms include headaches, increasing drowsiness<br />\nand confusion. A phaeochromocytoma (E) is a rare malignancy of the<br />\nsympathetic nervous system, clinical features are secondary to the action of<br />\nexcess catecholamine release, which is usually at random rather than a<br />\nconstant feature and include sweating, panic attacks, tremor and flushing..</p>"

The antibodies, usually IgG,<br />\nattack both the alveolar and basement membranes. Primary biliary cirrhosis<br />\nis usually associated with anti-mitochondrial antibodies (C). Wegener’s<br />\ngranulomatosis (B) is most commonly associated with anti-neutrophilic<br />\ncytoplasmic antibodies. Pernicious anaemia (D) clinically presents with<br />\nfeatures of anaemia, such as pallor, malaise and shortness of breath, and is<br />\nmost commonly associated with anti-parietal antibodies. Post-streptococcal<br />\nglomerulonephritis (E) is usually associated with haematuria and<br />\nhypertension following a streptococcal infection, which leads to an acute<br />\nnephritis due to antibody cross-reactivity. There is no associated alveolar<br />\ndamage..</p>"

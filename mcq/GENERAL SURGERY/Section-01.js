This was based on studies that reported much lower penile cancer rates among circumcised men than among uncircumcised men. But in some studies, the protective effect of circumcision wasn't seen after factors like smegma and phimosis were taken into account. Still, some experts have said that circumcision prevents penile cancer.<br />\n<br />\nIn the US, the risk of penile cancer is low even among uncircumcised men.

For milder cases of vitamin B-12 deficiency, treatment may involve changes to your diet and vitamin B-12 supplements in pill form or as a nasal spray. Your doctor may suggest vitamin B-12 injections, particularly if your vitamin B-12 deficiency is severe. At first, you may receive the shots as often as every other day. Eventually, you'll need injections just once a month, which may continue for life, depending on your situation..</p>"

All the classic findings of a tension pneumothorax are given in the vignette.<br />\nTracheobronchial injuries (choice A) can indeed produce subcutaneous emphysema. They can also produce air embolism if major vessels and major elements of the airway are lacerated next to one another. When that happens, though, the clinical manifestation is sudden death, typically when the patient is placed on a respirator.<br />\nFlail chest (choice B) is also likely to occur with multiple rib fractures, but the clinical clue is paradoxical breathing, and the eventual problem is respiratory distress but no hemodynamicdecompensation.<br />\nMassive bleeding, whether from torn intercostals or ruptured aorta (choices C and D) would indeed lead to hypovolemic shock, but the central venous pressure would be zero and breathing would not be particularly affected..</p>"

Acute diverticulitis has an acute onset of severe abdominal pain that is most likely located in the lower left quadrant. Patients with the first bout of diverticulitis are treated medically if there are no complications warranting surgery. However, recurrent diverticulitis will need resection of the affected loop of bowel. The most common complication after diverticulitis is abscess formation. Appendicitis gives pain in the right lower quadrant. Diverticulosis can occur anywhere in the colon, but in elderly patients, the sigmoid region is most involved, making it the most likely location for inflammation. Diverticulitis is highly associated with constipation. Pregnancy is implausible in this age group. Cholecystitis would have right upper quadrant pain.

Pilonidal cyst is an acute or chronic abscess of the sacrococcygeal region arising from an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Risk factors include poor hygiene, obesity, and<br />\nthe presence of a deep natal cleft. When a person with these risk factors sits or bends, the natal cleft stretches, damaging or breaking hair follicles and opening a pore, or “pit,” which collects debris (roots of hairs shed from the head, back, or buttocks).

Risk factors include advanced age, female gender, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and family history. Essentials of diagnosis 1. Atrophic macular degeneration (“Dry AMD”): Gradual painless central vision deficiency (with blurred vision), the more common type. Peripheral vision and eye moving are usually normal. 2. Exudative macular degeneration (“Wet AMD”): Less common but more rapid and severe painless central vision loss (due to leakage of serous fluid into the retina followed by neovasculization). 3. Fundoscopy (Image 151): It shows pigmentary or hemorrhagic lesion in the macular region—central scotomata, line distortion, and drusen form (yellowish-white deposits). Treatment 1. “Dry AMD”: Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) is recommended because it contains high-dose Vit-A and C, lutein, and zeaxanthin in lieu of beta-carotene (for risk of lung cancer). Quit smoking. 2. “Wet AMD”: (1) The best initial therapy for foveal lesion and neovasculization is VEGF inhibitors such as bevacizumab or ranibizumab, which are injected into the vitreous chamber and can effectively slow down progression. (2) Laser photocoagulation may delay central vision loss in exudative macular degeneration and proliferative retinopathy. However, the effect is limited.</p>.</p>"

If present during a large part of childhood, it may result in amblyopia or loss of depth perception. If onset is during adulthood, it is more likely to result in double vision.<br />\nTreatment depends on the type of strabismus and the underlying cause.This may include the use of glasses and possibly surgery. Some types benefit from early surgery. Strabismus occurs in about 2% of children.The term is from the Greek strabismós, meaning \"to squint\".Other terms for the condition include \"squint\" and \"cast of the eye\". \"Wall-eye\" has been used when the eyes turn away from each other.<br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus</a>.</p>"

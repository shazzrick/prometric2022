There are two major subgroups of systemic sclerosis based on the extent of skin involvement: limited and diffuse. The limited form affects areas below, but not above, the elbows and knees with or without the involvement of the face. The diffuse form also affects the skin above the elbows and knees and can also spread to the torso. Visceral organs, including the kidneys, heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract can also be affected by the fibrotic process. Prognosis is determined by the form of the disease and the extent of visceral involvement. Patients with limited systemic sclerosis have a better prognosis than those with the diffuse form. Death is most often caused by lung, heart, and kidney involvement. There is also a slight increase in the risk of cancer.<br />\n<br />\nSurvival rates have greatly increased with effective treatment for kidney failure.

It can take many hours, or even days, before you're in established labour.<br />\n<br />\nEstablished labour is when your cervix has dilated to about 4cm and regular contractions are opening your cervix.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the latent phase, it's a good idea to have something to eat and drink because you'll need energy for when labour is established.<br />\n<br />\nIf your labour starts at night, try to stay comfortable and relaxed. Sleep if you can.<br />\n<br />\nIf your labour starts during the day, stay upright and gently active. This helps your baby move down into your pelvis and helps your cervix to dilate.<br />\n<br />\nBreathing exercises, massage and having a warm bath or shower may help ease pain during this early stage of labour.<br />\n<br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/search?bih=631&biw=1517&rlz=1C1GCEU_enIN852IN853&hl=en&ei=beBRYO2aGJ-O4-EPl7eMkAs&q=first+stage+of+labour&oq=first+stage+of+labour&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgAEEMyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6CAgAEOoCEI8BOgUIABCRAjoFCAAQsQM6CAgAELEDEIMBOgUILhCxAzoLCC4QsQMQxwEQowI6CAguEMcBEK8BUJc0WJJYYJBgaAFwAngAgAHhAYgBnRqSAQYwLjIwLjKYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6sAEKwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwithfW1lbfvAhUfxzgGHZcbA7IQ4dUDCA0&uact=5\">https://www.google.com/search?bih=631&biw=1517&rlz=1C1GCEU_enIN852IN853&hl=en&ei=beBRYO2aGJ-O4-EPl7eMkAs&q=first+stage+of+labour&oq=first+stage+of+labour&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgAEEMyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6CAgAEOoCEI8BOgUIABCRAjoFCAAQsQM6CAgAELEDEIMBOgUILhCxAzoLCC4QsQMQxwEQowI6CAguEMcBEK8BUJc0WJJYYJBgaAFwAngAgAHhAYgBnRqSAQYwLjIwLjKYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6sAEKwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwithfW1lbfvAhUfxzgGHZcbA7IQ4dUDCA0&uact=5</a>.</p>"

In cases where this occurs despite good adherence, spironolactone (B) is often highly effective,although it is not clear why. Verapamil (E) is very occasionally added to a dihydropyridine in severe hypertension. If he is already a patient of the hypertension clinic, one can presume that he has been screened for possible secondary causes (C and D), so this is very likely to be primary hypertension..</p>"

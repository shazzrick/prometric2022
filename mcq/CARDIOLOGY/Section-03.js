The main difference between CK-MB and troponin is that CK-MB only stays elevated 1–2 days while troponin stays elevated for 1–2 weeks. Therefore, CK-MB testing is the best test to detect a reinfarction a few days after the initial infarction.<br />\n<br />\nThe CK-MB level should return to normal 2–3 days after myocardial infarction. If reinfarction has occurred, the level will go back up again 5 days later, while the troponin level will still be up from the original infarction. Troponin can be elevated for 2 weeks after an infarction. Angiography can detect obstructive, stenotic lesions but cannot detect myocardial necrosis.</p>"

The main difference between CK-MB and troponin is that CK-MB only stays elevated 1–2 days while troponin stays elevated for 1–2 weeks. Therefore, CK-MB testing is the best test to detect a reinfarction a few days after the initial infarction.<br />\n<br />\nThe CK-MB level should return to normal 2–3 days after myocardial infarction. If reinfarction has occurred, the level will go back up again 5 days later, while the troponin level will still be up from the original infarction. Troponin can be elevated for 2 weeks after an infarction. Angiography can detect obstructive, stenotic lesions but cannot detect myocardial necrosis.</p>"

A secondary etiology may be suggested by symptoms (e.g., flushing and sweating suggestive of pheochromocytoma), examination findings (e.g., a renal bruit suggestive of renal artery stenosis), or laboratory abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia suggestive of aldosteronism). Secondary hypertension also should be considered in patients with resistant hypertension, and early or late onset of hypertension. The prevalence of secondary hypertension and the most common etiologies vary by age group. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of adults with hypertension have a secondary cause. In young adults, particularly women, renal artery stenosis caused by fibromuscular dysplasia is one of the most common secondary etiologies. Fibromuscular dysplasia can be detected by abdominal magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. These same imaging modalities can be used to detect atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, a major cause of secondary hypertension in older adults. In middle-aged adults, aldosteronism is the most common secondary cause of hypertension, and the recommended initial diagnostic test is an aldosterone/renin ratio. Up to 85 percent of children with hypertension have an identifiable cause, most often renal parenchymal disease.

Digoxin decreases symptoms but does not lower mortality.<br />\n<br />\nSpironolactone is anti-androgenic. Spironolactone causes gynecomastia and erectile dysfunction in men; switch to eplerenone. Eplerenone is a mineralocorticoid antagonist. Eplerenone lowers mortality in CHF without the anti-androgenic side effects of spironolactone.<br />\n<br />\nThe familiar diuretic spironolactone has taken on new life as a treatment for left-sided congestive heart failure.

Other causes include high cholesterol, family history, smoking, trauma, infection (No.1 is syphilis), congenital weakness (Marfan syndrome), or elder men. Most AAAs occur between the renal arteries and iliac bifurcation. The incidence increases with age and more common in men. <br />\n<br />\nLab diagnosis: <br />\n(1) Ultrasound is usually the initial diagnostic tool. <br />\n(2) CT or aortography with contrast is the most accurate and confirmative means of diagnosis. <br />\n(3) Plain X-ray often picks up an AA accidentally with aortic wall calcification. <br />\n<br />\nTreatment <br />\n1. Symptomatic patients should be hospitalized and prepared for surgical fixing. Ruptured AA or impending rupture requires IV fluid and packed RBC followed by an emergent operation to save life. <br />\n2.

Other causes include high cholesterol, family history, smoking, trauma, infection (No.1 is syphilis), congenital weakness (Marfan syndrome), or elder men. Most AAAs occur between the renal arteries and iliac bifurcation. The incidence increases with age and more common in men. <br />\n<br />\nLab diagnosis: <br />\n(1) Ultrasound is usually the initial diagnostic tool. <br />\n(2) CT or aortography with contrast is the most accurate and confirmative means of diagnosis. <br />\n(3) Plain X-ray often picks up an AA accidentally with aortic wall calcification. <br />\n<br />\nTreatment <br />\n1. Symptomatic patients should be hospitalized and prepared for surgical fixing. Ruptured AA or impending rupture requires IV fluid and packed RBC followed by an emergent operation to save life. <br />\n2.

Low blood pressure occurs due to decreased systemic vascular resistance resulting in pooling of blood within the extremities lacking sympathetic tone. The slowed heart rate results from unopposed vagal activity and has been found to be exacerbated by hypoxia and endobronchial suction.[1] Neurogenic shock can be a potentially devastating complication, leading to organ dysfunction and death if not promptly recognized and treated.

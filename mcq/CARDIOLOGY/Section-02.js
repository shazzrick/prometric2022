Aortic stenosis needs surgical removal or replacement by catheter.<br />\n<br />\nTreatment 1. Medical therapy: Diuretics and salt-restricted diet for pulmonary congestion and edema; digitalis (to control the ventricle rate) and long-term oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation. For rheumatic MS, percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) is preferred to surgery. 2. Surgery: For most congenital MS and cases with persistent symptomatic despite above treatment, commissurotomy, balloon valvuloplasty, or valve replacement (more severe) usually produces good results. Open mitral commissurotomy or valve replacement is often indicated for patients with contraindications for valvuloplasty. Pulmonary hypertension is not a contraindication for the surgery.<br />\n<br />\nThe mitral valve is typically 4 to 6 square centimetres (0.62 to 0.93 sq in) in area and sits in the left heart between the left atrium and the left ventricle. It has two leaflets (or \"cusps\"), an anteromedial leaflet and a posterolateral leaflet. The opening of the mitral valve is surrounded by a fibrous ring known as the mitral annulus. The anterior cusp covers approximately two-thirds of the valve (imagine a crescent moon within the circle, where the crescent represents the posterior cusp). Although the anterior leaflet takes up a larger part of the ring and rises higher, the posterior leaflet has a larger surface area.<br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve#Disease\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve#Disease</a>.</p>"

It is very important to distinguish between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and HOCM. <br />\n<br />\nHCM is a reaction to stressors on the heart such as increased blood pressure. The heart hypertrophies to carry the load, but then develops difficulty “relaxing” in diastole. If the heart can’t relax to receive blood, the patient becomes short of breath. <br />\n<br />\nHOCM is a genetic disorder with an abnormal shape to the septum of the heart. The asymmetrically hypertrophied septum will literally form an anatomic obstruction between the septum and the valve leaflet to block blood leaving the heart.<br />\n<br />\nTIP-Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve is classic for HOCM. It contributes to obstruction.<br />\nHOCM-Echo is the best initial test. The septum is 1.5 times the thickness of the posterior wall.<br />\n<br />\nTreatment-HOCM<br />\n1. Beta blockers are the “best initial therapy” for HOCM.<br />\n2. Agents with strong negative inotropic qualities such as verapamil and disopyramide can also be useful. Diuretics may help in HCM, but they are contraindicated in HOCM.<br />\n<br />\nHOCM: Specific Therapy <br />\n1. Implantable defibrillators should be used in any HOCM patient with syncope. <br />\n2. Ablation of the septum should first be tried with a catheter placing absolute alcohol in the muscle causing small infarctions. If symptoms persist, surgical myomectomy removing part of the septum is the ultimate therapy.<br />\n<br />\nTIPS-In HOCM, ACEIs and diuretics definitely do not help. This is the major difference between HOCM and HCM.</p>"

It is very important to distinguish between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and HOCM. <br />\n<br />\nHCM is a reaction to stressors on the heart such as increased blood pressure. The heart hypertrophies to carry the load, but then develops difficulty “relaxing” in diastole. If the heart can’t relax to receive blood, the patient becomes short of breath. <br />\n<br />\nHOCM is a genetic disorder with an abnormal shape to the septum of the heart. The asymmetrically hypertrophied septum will literally form an anatomic obstruction between the septum and the valve leaflet to block blood leaving the heart.<br />\n<br />\nTIP-Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve is classic for HOCM. It contributes to obstruction.<br />\nHOCM-Echo is the best initial test. The septum is 1.5 times the thickness of the posterior wall.<br />\n<br />\nTreatment-HOCM<br />\n1. Beta blockers are the “best initial therapy” for HOCM.<br />\n2. Agents with strong negative inotropic qualities such as verapamil and disopyramide can also be useful. Diuretics may help in HCM, but they are contraindicated in HOCM.<br />\n<br />\nHOCM: Specific Therapy <br />\n1. Implantable defibrillators should be used in any HOCM patient with syncope. <br />\n2. Ablation of the septum should first be tried with a catheter placing absolute alcohol in the muscle causing small infarctions. If symptoms persist, surgical myomectomy removing part of the septum is the ultimate therapy.<br />\n<br />\nTIPS-In HOCM, ACEIs and diuretics definitely do not help. This is the major difference between HOCM and HCM.</p>"

The stress response is induced by exercise or by intravenous pharmacological stimulation. <br />\nCardiac stress tests compare the coronary circulation while the patient is at rest with the same patient's circulation during maximum cardiac exertion, showing any abnormal blood flow to the myocardium (heart muscle tissue). The results can be interpreted as a reflection on the general physical condition of the test patient. This test can be used to diagnose coronary artery disease (also known as ischemic heart disease) and assess patient prognosis after a myocardial infarction (heart attack). <br />\nExercise-induced stressors are most commonly either exercise on a treadmill or pedalling a stationary exercise bicycle ergometer.[1] The level of stress is progressively increased by raising the difficulty (steepness of the slope on a treadmill or resistance on an ergometer) and speed. People who cannot use their legs may exercise with a bicycle-like crank that they turn with their arms.[2] Once the stress test is completed, the patient generally is advised to not suddenly stop activity but to slowly decrease the intensity of the exercise over the course of several minutes. <br />\n<br />\nDiagnostic value[edit]<br />\nThe common approach for stress testing by American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association indicates the following:[7] <br />\nTreadmill test: sensitivity 73-90%, specificity 50-74% (Modified Bruce protocol)<br />\nNuclear test: sensitivity 81%, specificity 85-95%<br />\n(Sensitivity is the percentage of people with the condition who are correctly identified by the test as having the condition. Specificity is the percentage of people without the condition are correctly identified by the test as not having the condition)..</p>"

The stress response is induced by exercise or by intravenous pharmacological stimulation. <br />\nCardiac stress tests compare the coronary circulation while the patient is at rest with the same patient's circulation during maximum cardiac exertion, showing any abnormal blood flow to the myocardium (heart muscle tissue). The results can be interpreted as a reflection on the general physical condition of the test patient. This test can be used to diagnose coronary artery disease (also known as ischemic heart disease) and assess patient prognosis after a myocardial infarction (heart attack). <br />\nExercise-induced stressors are most commonly either exercise on a treadmill or pedalling a stationary exercise bicycle ergometer.[1] The level of stress is progressively increased by raising the difficulty (steepness of the slope on a treadmill or resistance on an ergometer) and speed. People who cannot use their legs may exercise with a bicycle-like crank that they turn with their arms.[2] Once the stress test is completed, the patient generally is advised to not suddenly stop activity but to slowly decrease the intensity of the exercise over the course of several minutes. <br />\n<br />\nDiagnostic value[edit]<br />\nThe common approach for stress testing by American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association indicates the following:[7] <br />\nTreadmill test: sensitivity 73-90%, specificity 50-74% (Modified Bruce protocol)<br />\nNuclear test: sensitivity 81%, specificity 85-95%<br />\n(Sensitivity is the percentage of people with the condition who are correctly identified by the test as having the condition. Specificity is the percentage of people without the condition are correctly identified by the test as not having the condition)..</p>"

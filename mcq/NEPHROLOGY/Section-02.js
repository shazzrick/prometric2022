Sodium homeostasis involves insensible and<br />\nobligatory loss followed by the dominant influence of the kidney. Factors controlling sodium reabsorption include the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, natriuretic peptides and indirectly anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). Hyponatraemia arising from water overload (E) often occurs in patients following surgical procedures with inappropriate fluid management. In this case, excess dextrose solution causes dilutional hyponatraemia resulting in acute delirium. Addison’s disease (A) results in a deficiency of mineralocorticoid activity causing an accumulation of potassium and reduced sodium reabsorption which is not reflected in the patient’s biochemistry results. The SIADH (B) is due to inappropriately elevated levels of ADH which leads to increased retention of water causing hyponatraemia and reduced serum osmolality. The syndrome does not<br />\ntypically cause hypokalaemia and the urine would be more concentrated due to water reabsorption. Diabetic nephropathy (C) is a progressive disease That arises in diabetic patients, pathology is characterized by an initial increase in glomerular filtration rate and glomerular basement membrane hypertrophy. As the disease progresses, glomerulosclerosis occurs as a result of accumulation of extracellular matrix and destroying the filtering ability of the glomerular membrane. This allows protein leakage. Severe diabetic nephropathy may present with symptoms of the nephrotic syndrome and acute derangement of biochemistry does not occur.

                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Correct!</p><p>Correct answer is A : Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis<br/>The majority of tubulointerstitial nephritis (A) is due to drug hypersensitivity reactions, most commonly penicillin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which are commonly given. Patients typically present with fever, skin rashes and may also have painful joints. Blood results will often have raised eosinophils. Eosinophils are involved in allergic responses, such as asthma and drugs, parasitic infection and also tissue inflammation. Renal failure (B) is the sudden loss of renal function which in the acute phase is reversible, plasma urea and creatinine typically increase due to the loss of filtering function of the kidney and patients tend to be oliguric rather than polyuric. In diabetes (C), although patients would tend to visit the toilet more due to hyperglycaemia causing an osmotic diuresis, other important features would include weight loss, polydipsia and the presence of glucose and possibly ketones on urine dipstick. A UTI (D) is characterized by features that include dysuria, elevated white cell count and raised leukocytes and nitrites in the urine. Reiter’s disease (E) is a sterile synovitis that typically follows an infection and involves the classical triad of urethritis, arthritis and conjunctivitis..</p>"

Patients typically present with fever, skin rashes and may also have painful joints. Blood results will often have raised eosinophils. Eosinophils are involved in allergic responses, such as asthma and drugs, parasitic infection and also tissue inflammation. Renal failure (B) is the sudden loss of renal function which in the acute phase is reversible, plasma urea and creatinine typically increase due to the loss of filtering function of the kidney and patients tend to be oliguric rather than polyuric. In diabetes (C), although patients would tend to visit the toilet more due to hyperglycaemia causing an osmotic diuresis, other important features would include weight loss, polydipsia and the presence of glucose and possibly ketones on urine dipstick. A UTI (D) is characterized by features that include dysuria, elevated white cell count and raised leukocytes and nitrites in the urine. Reiter’s disease (E) is a sterile synovitis that typically follows an infection and involves the classical triad of urethritis, arthritis and conjunctivitis..</p>"

Such factors include cigarette<br />\nsmoke, chemicals used in the rubber and dye industry and medications such<br />\nas aristolochic acid present in many herbal remedies for weight loss. The<br />\nmost common symptom of bladder cancer is painless haematuria alongside<br />\nsignificant weight loss. Chinese herb nephropathy (A) results from the same<br />\noffending chemical aristocholic acid, as a mistaken chosen component in<br />\nthe herbal preparation. However, the nephropathy is characterized by an<br />\naggressive progression to end-stage renal failure with hypertension, proteinuria<br />\nand haematuria. In the absence of flank pain and an abdominal or flank mass<br />\nrenal cell carcinoma (E), the patient does have the worrying sign of significant<br />\nunintended weight loss (remedies for weight loss having been stopped a<br />\nconsiderable time before weight loss was noticed). Acute tubulointerstitial<br />\nnephritis (D) is a drug hypersensitivity reaction most commonly to penicillin<br />\nor NSAIDs and painless haematuria is suggestive of a more sinister pathology.<br />\nSchistosomiasis (C) can cause bladder cancer through chronic inflammation,<br />\nhowever, other symptoms include a local dermatitis at the area of penetration<br />\nwhile more systemic features include fevers, muscle pain and allergic rashes..</p>"

                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Nope!</p><p>Correct answer is B : Bladder cancer<br/>The renal system from the kidneys to the urethra is lined by transitional cell<br />\nepithelium which is vulnerable to a number of predisposing factors of<br />\ncancers, in particular bladder cancer (B). Such factors include cigarette<br />\nsmoke, chemicals used in the rubber and dye industry and medications such<br />\nas aristolochic acid present in many herbal remedies for weight loss. The<br />\nmost common symptom of bladder cancer is painless haematuria alongside<br />\nsignificant weight loss. Chinese herb nephropathy (A) results from the same<br />\noffending chemical aristocholic acid, as a mistaken chosen component in<br />\nthe herbal preparation. However, the nephropathy is characterized by an<br />\naggressive progression to end-stage renal failure with hypertension, proteinuria<br />\nand haematuria. In the absence of flank pain and an abdominal or flank mass<br />\nrenal cell carcinoma (E), the patient does have the worrying sign of significant<br />\nunintended weight loss (remedies for weight loss having been stopped a<br />\nconsiderable time before weight loss was noticed). Acute tubulointerstitial<br />\nnephritis (D) is a drug hypersensitivity reaction most commonly to penicillin<br />\nor NSAIDs and painless haematuria is suggestive of a more sinister pathology.<br />\nSchistosomiasis (C) can cause bladder cancer through chronic inflammation,<br />\nhowever, other symptoms include a local dermatitis at the area of penetration<br />\nwhile more systemic features include fevers, muscle pain and allergic rashes..</p>"

Patients with poorly<br />\ncontrolled diabetes have increased risk of infection. Parenchymal infection<br />\nresults in gas accumulation which is identifiable on CT scan, patients may<br />\notherwise present similarly to a case of pyelonephritis, however rapid<br />\ntreatment is required to prevent a more fulminating clinical course. Gas in<br />\nthe renal parenchyma is not ever seen in answers A–D. Renal stones (A)<br />\ncan cause exquisite pain, often in a loin to groin pattern, they are rarely<br />\ncoincident with renal infection as suggested by the urine dipstick and<br />\nsuch stones are also very well identified by CT scanning. Renal infarction<br />\n(B) commonly presents with flank pain or chronic abdominal pain.<br />\nPatients usually have cardiovascular risk factors which can precipitate<br />\nthromboembolism such as atrial fibrillation. CT scan is usually successful<br />\nin identifying areas of infarct. Diabetic nephropathy (C) causes progressive<br />\ndamage to the filtering capacity of the kidney due to poor diabetes control.<br />\nThere is an initial increase in GFR that eventually causes glomerulosclerosis<br />\ntypically called ‘Kimmelstiel–Wilson lesions’. This allows the passage of<br />\nprotein into the urine but not blood, which is detected in this patient.<br />\nRenal TB (D) can often be vague in presentation, symptoms tend to be long<br />\nterm and include urinary frequency, dysuria and blood or pus in the urine.<br />\nPatients are often treated unsuccessfully for UTI before TB is considered.</p>"

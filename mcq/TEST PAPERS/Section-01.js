He has a 40-<br />\npack-year smoking history and currently smokes 1 pack per day. Examination is<br />\nnotable for end-expiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase on lung<br />\nauscultation. He has 3/5 hip flexion and decreased deep tendon reflexes bilaterally<br />\nin lower extremities. Laboratory tests are normal including electrolytes.

She especially has difficulty climbing and descending stairs. She<br />\nhas full range of motion without pain. She has no tenderness along medial or<br />\nlateral joint lines. Examination reveals negative anterior and posterior drawer<br />\ntests, full ROM in flexion and extension without crepitus, no effusion or erythema<br />\npresent. X-rays of the knee reveal normal alignment with preservation of joint<br />\nspace. Labs: Na 135 mEq/L, K 4.0 mEq/L, Cr 2.3 mg/dL. ANA is positive. ESR<br />\n10 mm/hr. What is appropriate next step in the management of this patient?</p>"

Another less sensitive but more specific finding is painful, well-demarcated mucocutaneous ulcerations. Additional clues to the diagnosis in this case are the patient’s high-risk behaviors (unprotected sex, IV drug use) and negative test results for other conditions on the differential diagnosis (mononucleosis due to EBV, syphilis, and other STIs, etc.). During the acute phase of HIV infection, there may be a negative screening test (ELISA may take weeks to become positive) with high viral RNA levels. Typically, the diagnosis of HIV is made with a highly sensitive screening test (e.g., ELISA) followed by a more specific confirmatory test (e.g., Western blot). (A) The finding of diffuse nontender lymphadenopathy is more consistent with a systemic process such as a viral infection rather than Hodgkin lymphoma, which often presents with focal or asymmetric lymphadenopathy.

If the chest x-ray is negative, then the patient has latent TB and should be treated with 9 months of isoniazid and pyridoxine (vitamin B6 , which helps to prevent isoniazid-induced neuropathy). Alternatively, other treatment options include isoniazid for 6 months, isoniazide and rifapentine for 3 months, or rifampin for 4 months.

If the chest x-ray is negative, then the patient has latent TB and should be treated with 9 months of isoniazid and pyridoxine (vitamin B6 , which helps to prevent isoniazid-induced neuropathy). Alternatively, other treatment options include isoniazid for 6 months, isoniazide and rifapentine for 3 months, or rifampin for 4 months. (A) Treatment of active TB is becoming complicated with MDR TB, however active TB is generally treated with a 4-drug regimen (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) for 2 months followed up a 2-drug regimen (rifampin, isoniazid) for 4 months. (B) Because this patient is a healthcare worker, she should be treated for latent TB given the risk of reactivation and exposure to other patients. (D) A chest x-ray should be performed before starting treatment to differentiate latent from active TB. (E) Reassurance would only be appropriate if the PPD result was negative.</p>.</p>"

Once AKI is recognized, the next step in diagnosis is<br />\ndetermining whether the etiology is prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. These<br />\nterms reflect the perceived sight of pathology; prerenal AKI is caused by<br />\ndecreased blood flow to the kidneys, intrinsic renal AKI is caused by direct<br />\ndamage to the kidney parenchyma (i.e., to the renal vasculature,<br />\ntubules/interstitium, or glomeruli), and postrenal AKI is caused by an obstruction<br />\nin the urinary tract leading away from the kidneys. The patient in this question is<br />\nhypovolemic (tachycardia and dry mucus membranes). In response to<br />\nhypovolemia, the renal arterioles vasoconstrict, decreasing blood flow to the<br />\nkidneys and decreasing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Prerenal AKI is a<br />\nresult of ischemia from poor perfusion, however it can progress to acute tubular<br />\nnecrosis (ATN), which is a form of intrinsic renal AKI. Besides hypovolemia, her<br />\ndaily NSAID may also be contributing to the AKI since NSAIDs cause renal<br />\nvasoconstriction. One of the best tests for differentiating between prerenal AKI<br />\nand ATN is the FENa. In prerenal AKI, sodium is reabsorbed in an attempt to<br />\nmaintain circulating blood volume, and therefore there will be little sodium in the<br />\nurine. (B) Although this is often reflected by the urine sodium, this value is<br />\naffected by renal water handling and urine output. FENa is a better test, since it<br />\nonly measures the fraction of sodium excretion and is not affected by urine<br />\noutput. In general, low FENa values indicate prerenal AKI and high values<br />\nindicate intrinsic renal AKI (tubular damage leads to salt wasting). The FENa will<br />\nbe <1>2% in ATN. (Note: FENa should not be used in the<br />\nsetting of diuretics, but the fractional excretion of urea may be used instead.) (A)<br />\nA urine dipstick is a helpful screening tool for things like proteinuria or infection,<br />\nbut it will not help to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic renal AKI. (D) A<br />\nrenal ultrasound would be helpful in excluding postrenal AKI, which is not<br />\nsuspected in this case.

Besides hypovolemia, her<br />\ndaily NSAID may also be contributing to the AKI since NSAIDs cause renal<br />\nvasoconstriction. One of the best tests for differentiating between prerenal AKI<br />\nand ATN is the FENa. In prerenal AKI, sodium is reabsorbed in an attempt to<br />\nmaintain circulating blood volume, and therefore there will be little sodium in the<br />\nurine. (B) Although this is often reflected by the urine sodium, this value is<br />\naffected by renal water handling and urine output. FENa is a better test, since it<br />\nonly measures the fraction of sodium excretion and is not affected by urine<br />\noutput. In general, low FENa values indicate prerenal AKI and high values<br />\nindicate intrinsic renal AKI (tubular damage leads to salt wasting). The FENa will<br />\nbe <1>2% in ATN. (Note: FENa should not be used in the<br />\nsetting of diuretics, but the fractional excretion of urea may be used instead.) (A)<br />\nA urine dipstick is a helpful screening tool for things like proteinuria or infection,<br />\nbut it will not help to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic renal AKI. (D) A<br />\nrenal ultrasound would be helpful in excluding postrenal AKI, which is not<br />\nsuspected in this case. (E) The diagnosis of prerenal AKI versus ATN cannot be<br />\nmade by history alone.</p>"

The fact that the pain is<br />\nworsened with activity and relieved by rest suggests that it is most likely<br />\nsecondary to osteoarthritis (OA). If she reported morning stiffness lasting greater<br />\nthan 30 minutes and had systemic symptoms, rheumatoid arthritis would have<br />\nbeen the likely diagnosis. OA is a noninflammatory arthritis that results in eroding<br />\ncartilage in the intra-articular joints. This causes joint crepitus (a “grating” or<br />\npopping sound) that occurs when the surfaces of the joint grind against each other.<br />\nAlthough the diagnosis is usually made clinically, the typical changes seen on xray include joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis (increased bone<br />\nformation around the joint), subchondral cyst formation, and osteophytes.<br />\nAcetaminophen is the first-line treatment for mild to moderate OA. It is just as<br />\nefficacious as NSAIDs in alleviating the pain in OA with considerably fewer side<br />\neffects. (A) Intra-articular corticosteroid injections lead to short-term pain relief<br />\nthat lasts up to a few months. This should not be the initial treatment in OA. (C)<br />\nNaproxen is an NSAID and although NSAIDs have been shown to be efficacious<br />\nin the treatment of OA, their side-effect profile consists of gastrointestinal and<br />\nrenal consequences that make them second-line treatments. (D) Allopurinol is<br />\nused in the prophylactic treatment of gout. It acts via inhibition of xanthine<br />\noxidase which decreases production of uric acid. It is not used in the treatment of<br />\nOA. (E) This patient is clearly in pain and would benefit from medication, so<br />\nobservation is inappropriate..</p>"

The fact that the pain is<br />\nworsened with activity and relieved by rest suggests that it is most likely<br />\nsecondary to osteoarthritis (OA). If she reported morning stiffness lasting greater<br />\nthan 30 minutes and had systemic symptoms, rheumatoid arthritis would have<br />\nbeen the likely diagnosis. OA is a noninflammatory arthritis that results in eroding<br />\ncartilage in the intra-articular joints. This causes joint crepitus (a “grating” or<br />\npopping sound) that occurs when the surfaces of the joint grind against each other.<br />\nAlthough the diagnosis is usually made clinically, the typical changes seen on xray include joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis (increased bone<br />\nformation around the joint), subchondral cyst formation, and osteophytes.<br />\nAcetaminophen is the first-line treatment for mild to moderate OA. It is just as<br />\nefficacious as NSAIDs in alleviating the pain in OA with considerably fewer side<br />\neffects. (A) Intra-articular corticosteroid injections lead to short-term pain relief<br />\nthat lasts up to a few months. This should not be the initial treatment in OA. (C)<br />\nNaproxen is an NSAID and although NSAIDs have been shown to be efficacious<br />\nin the treatment of OA, their side-effect profile consists of gastrointestinal and<br />\nrenal consequences that make them second-line treatments. (D) Allopurinol is<br />\nused in the prophylactic treatment of gout. It acts via inhibition of xanthine<br />\noxidase which decreases production of uric acid. It is not used in the treatment of<br />\nOA. (E) This patient is clearly in pain and would benefit from medication, so<br />\nobservation is inappropriate..</p>"

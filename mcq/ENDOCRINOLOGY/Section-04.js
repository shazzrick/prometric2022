                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Correct!</p><p>Correct answer is E : Urinary free cortisol measurement<br/>The patient appears to be suffering from cushingoid symptoms. After a history to exclude causes such as high-dose steroid intake, the main differential diagnoses include an adrenal tumour, an ectopic tumour producing ACTH (Cushing’s syndrome) or a pituitary tumour (Cushing’s disease). Although a 24-hour urinary free cortisol level measurement (E) does not confirm the exact diagnosis, it does indicate if there is a pathological excess of cortisol (levels can vary up to 700 nmol/L in the<br />\nmorning to 280 nmol/L at midnight). A low dose (0.5 mg) dexamethasone test (A) involves measuring ACTH after dexamethasone administration. In Cushing’s disease and syndrome, there is no suppression of ACTH. A highdose<br />\ndexamethasone test (B) will differentiate between Cushing’s disease and Cushing’s syndrome since only in the former is there suppressed ACTH production after high-dose dexamethasone administration. A CT scan (D) can be used to identify a pituitary tumour if requiring surgical management.<br />\n<br />\nUrinary catecholamine (C) measurement is used in the diagnosis of a phaeochromocytoma, an adrenal tumour producing excess catecholamines measurable in the urine. Differentiating an adrenal tumour producing excess cortisol can be done by administering metyrapone, an 11-?hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, which effectively ceases adrenal cortisol production. If cortisol is still high it is due to an ectopic source, e.g. lung tumour..</p>"

                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Nope!</p><p>Correct answer is E : Urinary free cortisol measurement<br/>The patient appears to be suffering from cushingoid symptoms. After a history to exclude causes such as high-dose steroid intake, the main differential diagnoses include an adrenal tumour, an ectopic tumour producing ACTH (Cushing’s syndrome) or a pituitary tumour (Cushing’s disease). Although a 24-hour urinary free cortisol level measurement (E) does not confirm the exact diagnosis, it does indicate if there is a pathological excess of cortisol (levels can vary up to 700 nmol/L in the<br />\nmorning to 280 nmol/L at midnight). A low dose (0.5 mg) dexamethasone test (A) involves measuring ACTH after dexamethasone administration. In Cushing’s disease and syndrome, there is no suppression of ACTH. A highdose<br />\ndexamethasone test (B) will differentiate between Cushing’s disease and Cushing’s syndrome since only in the former is there suppressed ACTH production after high-dose dexamethasone administration. A CT scan (D) can be used to identify a pituitary tumour if requiring surgical management.<br />\n<br />\nUrinary catecholamine (C) measurement is used in the diagnosis of a phaeochromocytoma, an adrenal tumour producing excess catecholamines measurable in the urine. Differentiating an adrenal tumour producing excess cortisol can be done by administering metyrapone, an 11-?hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, which effectively ceases adrenal cortisol production. If cortisol is still high it is due to an ectopic source, e.g. lung tumour..</p>"

Allergic responses may occasionally occur, but are usually<br />\nmild and resolve spontaneously. Importantly, patients should be encouraged<br />\nto alternate injection sites between the thighs, abdomen and shoulder to<br />\nprevent build up of adipose tissue creating smooth, firm lumps known as<br />\nlipohypertrophy (B). This is not dissimilar to a lipoma (D) which are benign<br />\nmasses consisting of fatty tissue enclosed by a fibrous capsule. They are<br />\nusually mobile, painless and soft on palpation. Worsening diabetes (A)<br />\ndoes not cause lipohypertrophy, but would likely worsen symptoms of<br />\ndiabetes such as weight loss and osmotic diuresis. Patients also increase<br />\ntheir risk of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy and<br />\nnephropathy. An injection abscess (E) can occur in any situation where<br />\nneedles are being used in poor sanitary conditions; the presentation,<br />\nhowever, is usually of a pus-filled cavity that is painful and erythematous..</p>"

The main types of pneumonia are bacterial, viral, and mycoplasma pneumonia.</li><li>A cough that produces green, yellow, or bloody mucus is the most common symptom of pneumonia. Other symptoms include fever, shaking chills, shortness of breath, low energy, and extreme tiredness.</li><li>Pneumonia can often be diagnosed with a thorough history and physical exam. Tests used to look at the lungs, blood tests, and tests done on the sputum you cough up may also be used.</li><li>Treatment depends on the type of pneumonia you have. Antibiotics are used for bacterial pneumonia. It may also speed recovery from mycoplasma pneumonia and some special cases. Most viral pneumonias don’t have a specific treatment and just get better on their own. Other treatment may include a healthy diet, more fluids, rest, oxygen therapy, and medicine for pain, cough, and fever control.</li><li>Most people with pneumonia respond well to treatment, but pneumonia can cause serious lung and infection problems.

The main types of pneumonia are bacterial, viral, and mycoplasma pneumonia.</li><li>A cough that produces green, yellow, or bloody mucus is the most common symptom of pneumonia. Other symptoms include fever, shaking chills, shortness of breath, low energy, and extreme tiredness.</li><li>Pneumonia can often be diagnosed with a thorough history and physical exam. Tests used to look at the lungs, blood tests, and tests done on the sputum you cough up may also be used.</li><li>Treatment depends on the type of pneumonia you have. Antibiotics are used for bacterial pneumonia. It may also speed recovery from mycoplasma pneumonia and some special cases. Most viral pneumonias don’t have a specific treatment and just get better on their own. Other treatment may include a healthy diet, more fluids, rest, oxygen therapy, and medicine for pain, cough, and fever control.</li><li>Most people with pneumonia respond well to treatment, but pneumonia can cause serious lung and infection problems. It can even be deadly.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/pneumonia\" target=\"_blank\">Pneumonia | Johns Hopkins Medicine</a></p>.</p>"

The following are risk factors for DVT<br />\n-Immobility <br />\n-Malignancy <br />\n-Trauma Surgery, especially joint replacement <br />\n-Thrombophilia, such a factor V mutation, lupus anticoagulant, or protein C and S deficiency<br />\n<br />\nDiagnosis<br />\n1- Chest x-ray: The most common result is normal. The most common abnormality found is atelectasis. Wedge-shaped infarction and pleuralbased humps are rare. <br />\n2-EKG: The most common showing is sinus tachycardia. The most common abnormality is nonspecific ST-T wave changes. Right axis deviation and right bundle branch block are uncommon. <br />\n3-ABG: This shows hypoxia with an increased A-a gradient and mild respiratory alkalosis.<br />\n4-CT Angiogram-is standard to confirm the presence of a pulmonary embolus. The CT angiogram is excellent if it is positive because of its specificity. The sensitivity of CT angiogram is > 95 percent. The CT angiogram is clearly the test of choice if the x-ray is abnormal. For pulmonary embolus, CT angiogram is 95 percent sensitive and specific.<br />\n5-V/Q Scan-scan to be accurate, the chest x-ray must be normal. The less normal the x-ray, the less accurate the V/Q scan. This is still a fairly good test for PE. The problem is that only a truly normal scan excludes a PE. Of patients with low-probability scans, 15 percent still have a PE, and 15 percent of those with of high-probability scans don’t have a PE. V/Q is done only with an absolute contraindication to CT angiogram.<br />\n<br />\n6-D-Dimer Testing<br />\nThis is a very sensitive test with poor specificity. If the D-dimer is negative, PE is extremely unlikely. The best use of D-dimer testing is in a patient with a low probability of PE in whom you want a single test to exclude PE.<br />\n7-Lower Extremity Doppler<br />\nThese are excellent tests if they are positive; if positive, no further diagnostic testing is necessary. The problem is that 30 percent of PEs originate in pelvic veins, and the Doppler scan is normal even in the presence of a PE. Hence, the sensitivity of lower extremity Doppler is about 70 percent<br />\n<br />\n8-Angiography<br />\nAngiography is the single most accurate test for PE. Unfortunately, angiography is invasive with a significant risk of death of about 0.5 percent. CT angiography makes angiography with a catheter rarely ever the best answer.<br />\n<br />\nTreatment<br />\n1-Low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin and oxygen: The standard of care in pulmonary embolism is to use either enoxaparin followed by warfarin or oral therapy with a NOAC from the start. Hemodynamically stable patients are best treated with a NOAC. 2-NOACs=Newer oral Anticoagulants- (rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban, dabigatran): These agents all have efficacy equal to warfarin, with less intracranial bleeding and without the need for INR monitoring. They are used in hemodynamically stable patients. NOACs do not need initial treatment with LMW heparin. <br />\n3-Warfarin: Should be used for 3–6 months after the use of heparin. <br />\n4-Venous interruption filter: This should be placed in all patients who have a contraindication to anticoagulation. Thrombolytics: These are used in patients who are hemodynamically unstable. Hemodynamic instability can be defined as hypotension. 5-Thrombolytics essentially replace embolectomy, which is rarely performed because of the high operative mortality<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTIPS-There are no specific physical findings for PE(PULMONARY EMBOLISM)<br />\nRef-MTB 3.</p>"

As opposed to dementia, delirium has an onset that is rapid; it may be precipitated by acute illness, particularly in people over 65; more specific precipitating factors include hypoxia and various medications.Haloperidol is dosed intravenously and increased every 30 minutes until the signs and symptoms improve. Anticholinergics such as benztropine (Cogentin, choice A) are contraindicated in dementia and delirium and in older people in general since they may precipitate confusion. As a sedating drug—its primary effect—diazepam is contraindicated<br />\nin all confusional states for the same reasons.Fluoxetine (Prozac) is an antidepressant of the SSRI family, and modafinil is a central stimulant used for daytime relief in narcoleptic states.<br />\nReference<br />\nFamily Medicine Board Review sponsored by the American<br />\nAcademy of Family Practice, 2009.

As opposed to dementia, delirium has an onset that is rapid; it may be precipitated by acute illness, particularly in people over 65; more specific precipitating factors include hypoxia and various medications.Haloperidol is dosed intravenously and increased every 30 minutes until the signs and symptoms improve. Anticholinergics such as benztropine (Cogentin, choice A) are contraindicated in dementia and delirium and in older people in general since they may precipitate confusion. As a sedating drug—its primary effect—diazepam is contraindicated<br />\nin all confusional states for the same reasons.Fluoxetine (Prozac) is an antidepressant of the SSRI family, and modafinil is a central stimulant used for daytime relief in narcoleptic states.<br />\nReference<br />\nFamily Medicine Board Review sponsored by the American<br />\nAcademy of Family Practice, 2009.

Pancreatic insufficiency, recurrent pancreatitis, nutritional deficiencies, steatorrhea, biliary cirrhosis, gallstones, distal intestinal obstruction, and male genital abnormalities, etc. <br />\n3. Diagnosis is confirmed by sweat chloride test—concentration above 60 mEq/L on two occasions. If chloride testing is intermediate, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene analysis should be done to confirm. CFTR genotyping is also necessary for most patients to determine if they carry one of the mutations approved for ivacaftor use. <br />\n<br />\nTreatment <br />\n1. Respiratory system: Long-term antibiotics (oral azithromycin for age > 6), inhaled bronchodilators (beta2agonists) or steroids, high-dose ibuprofen (if the lung function is good), chest physical therapy, and DNase I are recomended. For all patients with ivacaftor-mutation positive and > age 2, ivacaftor is used. <br />\n2. Digestive system: pancreatic enzymes and fat-soluble Vit (A, D, E, K) for malabsorption. <br />\n3. Lung or pancreas transplantation may be the only definitive treatment for advanced CF..</p>"

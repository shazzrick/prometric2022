L. pneumophilia (D), along with Chlamydia spp. and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, are the atypical pneumonia-causing organisms.

Exudates occur as a result of increased capillary permeability secondary to infection (pneumonia, tuberculosis), inflammation (pulmonary infarction, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE) or malignancy (bronhogenic carcinoma, secondary metastases, lymphoma, mesothelioma, lymphangitis carcinomatosis).

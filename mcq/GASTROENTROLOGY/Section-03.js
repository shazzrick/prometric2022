The fact that<br />\nthe patient’s observations are within the normal range and she is not<br />\nsystemically unwell, the most appropriate answer here would be to advise<br />\nthe patient on oral fluid rehydration and prescribe antiemetics (e.g.<br />\nmetocloperamide), followed by discharge..</p>"

The mainstay of treatment is to advise patients<br />\nto increase oral fluid intake (A) to compensate for the water lost from<br />\ndiarrhoea and vomiting. However, in some circumstances, where severe<br />\ndehydration secondary to profuse diarrhoea exists (leading to confusion<br />\nand hypotension) patients may warrant admission for intravenous fluid<br />\nrehydration (C). Antibiotic therapy (B) and (D) is usually not indicated for<br />\ngastroenteritis unless a bacterial organism has been isolated. The fact that<br />\nthe patient’s observations are within the normal range and she is not<br />\nsystemically unwell, the most appropriate answer here would be to advise<br />\nthe patient on oral fluid rehydration and prescribe antiemetics (e.g.<br />\nmetocloperamide), followed by discharge..</p>"

This chronic inflammatory process leads to<br />\ncholestasis, cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The cause of PBC is thought<br />\nto be of autoimmune origin (women being more affected than men) and is<br />\nassociated with various autoimmune conditions. Patients are often<br />\nasymptomatic and diagnosis is usually made when abnormal LFTs are<br />\ndetected with an abnormal rise in serum ALP. Symptoms include lethargy<br />\nand pruritus which can occur before the presentation of jaundice. Signs<br />\ninclude jaundice, xanthelasma, xanthomata, skin pigmentation,<br />\nsplenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Investigations include blood tests: (1)<br />\nLFTs (raised ALP, ?-GT, with mildly elevated AST and ALT. In late disease<br />\nthere is a raised bilirubin level and low levels of albumin with an increase<br />\nin the prothrombin time); (2) Ninety-eight per cent of patients with PBC<br />\nare anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) positive. ANA, SMA and ANCA<br />\nautoantibodies may also be present but at low titres; (3) IgM (usually<br />\nraised); (4) Raised levels of TSH and cholesterol may be present. Performing<br />\nradiological imaging, such as ultrasound, will exclude extrahepatic<br />\ncholestasis and liver biopsy will confirm granulomas (not specific to PBC)<br />\nsurrounding the bile ducts, progressing to cirrhosis.<br />\nTreatment is divided into:<br />\n• symptomatic – for symptoms of pruritus (e.g. colestyramine) ,<br />\ndiarrhoea (e.g. codeine phosphate) and osteoporosis (e.g.<br />\nbisphosphonates);<br />\n• specific – vitamin A, D, K supplementation, ursodeoxycholic acid for<br />\nimproving jaundice and ascites;<br />\n• liver transplantation for end-stage liver disease.<br />\nWilson’s disease (B) is an autosomal recessive disorder (of gene on<br />\nchromosome 13 that codes for copper transporting ATPase) resulting in<br />\ntoxic accumulation of copper in the liver and central nervous system.<br />\nTwenty-four hour urinary copper excretion is high (>100 ?g/24 h with<br />\nnormal levels being <40?g) with low copper and caeruloplasmin levels.<br />\nDiagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing and liver biopsy. Patients<br />\npresent with signs of liver disease. Kayser–Fleischer rings are pathognomonic<br />\n(copper deposits in iris). Hereditary haemochromatosis (C) is an inherited<br />\ncondition characterized by a disorder in iron metabolism. There is increased<br />\nintestinal iron absorption which is deposited in multiple organs such as the<br />\nliver, heart, pancreas, etc. LFTS are usually elevated with raised ferritin and<br />\nserum iron levels, and low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). Diagnosis<br />\ncan be confirmed with HFE (mutation in HFE gene is responsible for<br />\nhereditary haemochromatosis) genotyping and liver biopsy. Patients are<br />\ninitially asymptomatic then eventually experience arthralgia and tiredness<br />\nwith slate-grey skin pigmentation with late disease progression. Iron<br />\ndeposition also occurs in the pancreas leading to impaired insulin secretion<br />\nand eventually diabetes (also known as bronze diabetes). Primary sclerosing<br />\ncholangitis (D) is a condition of unknown cause which is defined by nonmalignant,<br />\nnon-bacterial inflammation, fibrosis and strictures of the intraand<br />\nextrahepatic bile ducts.

Performing<br />\nradiological imaging, such as ultrasound, will exclude extrahepatic<br />\ncholestasis and liver biopsy will confirm granulomas (not specific to PBC)<br />\nsurrounding the bile ducts, progressing to cirrhosis.<br />\nTreatment is divided into:<br />\n• symptomatic – for symptoms of pruritus (e.g. colestyramine) ,<br />\ndiarrhoea (e.g. codeine phosphate) and osteoporosis (e.g.<br />\nbisphosphonates);<br />\n• specific – vitamin A, D, K supplementation, ursodeoxycholic acid for<br />\nimproving jaundice and ascites;<br />\n• liver transplantation for end-stage liver disease.<br />\nWilson’s disease (B) is an autosomal recessive disorder (of gene on<br />\nchromosome 13 that codes for copper transporting ATPase) resulting in<br />\ntoxic accumulation of copper in the liver and central nervous system.<br />\nTwenty-four hour urinary copper excretion is high (>100 ?g/24 h with<br />\nnormal levels being <40?g) with low copper and caeruloplasmin levels.<br />\nDiagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing and liver biopsy. Patients<br />\npresent with signs of liver disease. Kayser–Fleischer rings are pathognomonic<br />\n(copper deposits in iris). Hereditary haemochromatosis (C) is an inherited<br />\ncondition characterized by a disorder in iron metabolism. There is increased<br />\nintestinal iron absorption which is deposited in multiple organs such as the<br />\nliver, heart, pancreas, etc. LFTS are usually elevated with raised ferritin and<br />\nserum iron levels, and low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). Diagnosis<br />\ncan be confirmed with HFE (mutation in HFE gene is responsible for<br />\nhereditary haemochromatosis) genotyping and liver biopsy. Patients are<br />\ninitially asymptomatic then eventually experience arthralgia and tiredness<br />\nwith slate-grey skin pigmentation with late disease progression. Iron<br />\ndeposition also occurs in the pancreas leading to impaired insulin secretion<br />\nand eventually diabetes (also known as bronze diabetes). Primary sclerosing<br />\ncholangitis (D) is a condition of unknown cause which is defined by nonmalignant,<br />\nnon-bacterial inflammation, fibrosis and strictures of the intraand<br />\nextrahepatic bile ducts. It is serum AMA negative but ANA, SMA and<br />\nANCA may be positive. Diagnosis is made with MRCP and liver biopsy.<br />\nPatients are initially asymptomatic and may present with jaundice, pruritus,<br />\nabdominal pain and fatigue. Alcoholic liver disease (E) is incorrect here as<br />\nthere is no mention, in the clinical scenario, of raised AST/ALT levels<br />\nwhich would signify hepatocellular damage..</p>"

Treatment of UC flare-ups is targeted<br />\nat inducing and maintaining remission. In this question, the patient,<br />\nalthough experiencing mild abdominal cramps, frequent bowel motions<br />\nand passing small amounts of blood per rectum, is systemically well. In<br />\naddition, her haemoglobin levels are within normal range and her CRP is<br />\n<10 mg/dL. Therefore, based on the information from the patient’s history<br />\ncoupled with the blood test results, hospital admission would not be<br />\nwarranted. This patient can be treated as an outpatient and followed up<br />\neither in clinic or by her GP. In terms of treatment regimens for moderate<br />\nUC, patients are usually started on a course of steroids (e.g. 40 mg of<br />\nprednisolone), which is decreased on a weekly basis coupled with twice<br />\ndaily 5-ASA (e.g. mesalazine) and topical treatment of per rectum steroid<br />\nfoams (e.g. hydrocortisone).

Treatment of UC flare-ups is targeted<br />\nat inducing and maintaining remission. In this question, the patient,<br />\nalthough experiencing mild abdominal cramps, frequent bowel motions<br />\nand passing small amounts of blood per rectum, is systemically well. In<br />\naddition, her haemoglobin levels are within normal range and her CRP is<br />\n<10 mg/dL. Therefore, based on the information from the patient’s history<br />\ncoupled with the blood test results, hospital admission would not be<br />\nwarranted. This patient can be treated as an outpatient and followed up<br />\neither in clinic or by her GP. In terms of treatment regimens for moderate<br />\nUC, patients are usually started on a course of steroids (e.g. 40 mg of<br />\nprednisolone), which is decreased on a weekly basis coupled with twice<br />\ndaily 5-ASA (e.g. mesalazine) and topical treatment of per rectum steroid<br />\nfoams (e.g. hydrocortisone).

In addition, there has been a 4.5 g/dL drop in the<br />\npatient’s haemoglobin. Tying in these clinical findings, ruling out a<br />\nmalignancy should be the priority. Therefore, from the list of answers<br />\nabove, the most appropriate plan of management would be to arrange an<br />\nupper and lower GI endoscopy (B)..</p>"

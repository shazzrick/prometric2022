There are two colic flexures in the transverse colon — the other being the hepatic flexure, as it is next to the liver, in the right upper quadrant. The splenic flexure is a watershed region as it receives dual blood supply from the terminal branches of the superior mesenteric artery and the inferior mesenteric artery, thus making it prone to ischemic damage in cases of low blood pressure because it does not have its own primary source of blood. In the context of ischemia, the splenic flexure is sometimes referred to as Griffith's point, along with the upper rectum (Sudak's point)..</p>"

                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Correct!</p><p>Correct answer is D : Anal fissure<br/>What is an anal fissure?<br />\nAn anal fissure is a split or tear in the lining of the anus, causes bleeding and burning pain after bowel movements. The usual cause is passing a very hard stool. The pain is caused by a spasm of the sphincter muscle. This happens as a protective measure by the body as stool passes through the anal canal and expands the tear. Bleeding is caused by trauma to the existing tear.<br />\n<br />\nFissures may be mistaken for and misdiagnosed as hemorrhoids. Fissures often improve by themselves, but if they don't, an ointment or medication applied directly to the fissure to relax the muscle can relieve the pain. Surgery may be needed for a chronic or recurrent (returning) fissure or if excessive sphincter spasms prevent the tear from healing on its own.

The usual cause is passing a very hard stool. The pain is caused by a spasm of the sphincter muscle. This happens as a protective measure by the body as stool passes through the anal canal and expands the tear. Bleeding is caused by trauma to the existing tear.<br />\n<br />\nFissures may be mistaken for and misdiagnosed as hemorrhoids.

A 45 y/o man presents with fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and loose stools of yellowish color for the past 3 days, beginning after he eat a large meal with friends. None of his friends has similar symptoms. He has a 5-year history of smoking, alcohol consumption, and decreased weight. P/E finds a moderate fever and a firm and distended abdomen with decreased bowel sounds, tenderness on deep palpation, and with rebound tenderness. Ascites is (+) and the spleen is enlarged. What’s the most important next test to determine the etiology?</p>"

MRI will show increased iron deposition in the liver. An abnormal MRI combined with an abnormal genetic test for hemochromatosis can spare the patient the need for a liver biopsy. There is an association with diabetes; however, glucose levels will not confirm a diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Prussian blue is the stain of blood cells for iron. Prussian blue is also used to diagnose sideroblastic anemia. Iron chelation therapy is used in hemochromatosis for those who: Cannot be managed with phlebotomy Are anemic and have hemochromatosis from overtransfusion such as thalassemia Deferoxamine, deferasirox, or deferiprone should not be started until the diagnosis is confirmed. Deferasirox and deferiprone are huge breakthrough medications because they are effective orally. Deferoxamine has to be given lifelong by injection.</p>.</p>"

MRI will show increased iron deposition in the liver. An abnormal MRI combined with an abnormal genetic test for hemochromatosis can spare the patient the need for a liver biopsy. There is an association with diabetes; however, glucose levels will not confirm a diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Prussian blue is the stain of blood cells for iron. Prussian blue is also used to diagnose sideroblastic anemia. Iron chelation therapy is used in hemochromatosis for those who: Cannot be managed with phlebotomy Are anemic and have hemochromatosis from overtransfusion such as thalassemia Deferoxamine, deferasirox, or deferiprone should not be started until the diagnosis is confirmed. Deferasirox and deferiprone are huge breakthrough medications because they are effective orally. Deferoxamine has to be given lifelong by injection.</p>.</p>"

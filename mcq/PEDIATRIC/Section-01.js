The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic endocarditis. During normal pregnancy there is an increase in the cardiac output and an increase in preload and circulating volume. Patients with mitral stenosis have a fixed, decreased valve area, which places them at risk for the development of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary edema. Control of arrhythmias is absolutely essential in these patients because they are at increased risk, given the left atrial enlargement that often goes along with their mitral stenosis. Labor and delivery can be a particularly dangerous time for these patients. Therefore, patients with significant mitral stenosis should be monitored invasively using a Swan-Ganz catheter. It is recommended that the second stage of labor be shortened using forceps or vacuum to prevent excess maternal Valsalva efforts and maternal tachycardia..</p>"

Beta blockers may shorten the QT interval by decreasing activation from the left stellate ganglion and reducing cardiac excitation during exertion. If this child has symptoms again while on a beta blocker, then a pacemaker with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator capability may be indicated..</p>"

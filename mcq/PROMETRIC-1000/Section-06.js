Even if surface antibody were one of the choices, the correct answer would still be surface antigen. Transmissibility stops when DNA polymerase stops, not when surface antibody appears. Jaundice (increase bilirubin) and ALT normalizes long before viral replications stops.you can definitely have viral replication, elevated DNA polymerase and positive surface antigen with normal ALT.Hepatitis B e antibody will appear before resolution of all DNA polymerase activity.it is an indication that the acute infection is moving towards resolution.but it doesnot conclusively prove that resolution has occurred..</p>"

They have no impact on calcium levels and the only time something would be found in the urine is in the case of papillary necrosis. Papillary necrosis causes sudden flank pain and fever. Methanol causes inflammation of the retina and has no renal toxicity. Opiates by injection are associated with focalsegmental glomerulonephritis, not AKI. In addition, that is only with the impurities found with injection drug use, certainly not opiate medications..</p>"

The most important step is to determine if there are EKG changes from hyperkalemia. If the EKG is abnormal, she needs calcium chloride or gluconate in order to protect her heart while the other interventions are performed. Kayexalate and dialysis take hours to remove potassium from the body. Bicarbonate and insulin work in 15 to 20 minutes, but they are not as instantaneous in effect as giving calcium..</p>"

If breast biopsy is going to be performed, what is the point in doing a screening test like mammography? The answer is: 5% to 10% of patients have bilateral disease. In addition, there is a huge difference in the management of the patient if there is a single lesion or multiple lesions within the same breast. BRCA testing confirms an extra risk of cancer compared to the general population, but will add nothing to a patient who must already undergo biopsy. Ultrasound is useful in evaluating whether masses that are equivocal by clinical examination are cystic or solid. Bone scan is used after a diagnosis of breast cancer is made to exclude occult metastases. PET scan helps determine the content of abnormal masses within the body or enlarged nodes without biopsy. However, PET scan does not eliminate the need to establish an initial diagnosis with biopsy..</p>"

                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Nope!</p><p>Correct answer is A : Mammography<br/>A. If breast biopsy is going to be performed, what is the point in doing a screening test like mammography? The answer is: 5% to 10% of patients have bilateral disease. In addition, there is a huge difference in the management of the patient if there is a single lesion or multiple lesions within the same breast. BRCA testing confirms an extra risk of cancer compared to the general population, but will add nothing to a patient who must already undergo biopsy. Ultrasound is useful in evaluating whether masses that are equivocal by clinical examination are cystic or solid. Bone scan is used after a diagnosis of breast cancer is made to exclude occult metastases. PET scan helps determine the content of abnormal masses within the body or enlarged nodes without biopsy. However, PET scan does not eliminate the need to establish an initial diagnosis with biopsy..</p>"

There is no specific therapy, and you do not need to switch the medication. If the rate of infusion is slowed, the reaction will not occur. Telavancin does not cause red man syndrome..</p>"

When there are clear vesicular lesions present, there is no need to do a specific diagnostic test for herpes.

Daily suppressive therapy can be prescribed for recurrent genital herpes. If the roofs come off the vesicles and the lesion becomes an ulcer of unclear etiology, then the best initial diagnostic test is a Tzanck prep. The most accurate test for herpes is a viral culture.

Oxygen, furosemide, nitrates, and morphine are the mainstay of therapy for acute pulmonary edema. Although they are not associated with a concrete mortality benefit, they are the standard of care for pulmonary edema, which is the worst manifestation of CHF. Removing volume from the vascular system and, therefore, the lungs is more important than any form of diagnostic testing. Pulmonary edema is a clinical diagnosis.

Oxygen, furosemide, nitrates, and morphine are the mainstay of therapy for acute pulmonary edema. Although they are not associated with a concrete mortality benefit, they are the standard of care for pulmonary edema, which is the worst manifestation of CHF. Removing volume from the vascular system and, therefore, the lungs is more important than any form of diagnostic testing. Pulmonary edema is a clinical diagnosis. Shortness of breath, rales, S3, and orthopnea are more important in establishing the diagnosis than any single test..</p>"

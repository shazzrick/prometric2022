The 2 ligaments are also called cruciform ligaments, as they are arranged in a crossed formation. In the quadruped stifle joint (analogous to the knee), based on its anatomical position, it is also referred to as the cranial cruciate ligament.[1] The term cruciate translates to cross. This name is fitting because the ACL crosses the posterior cruciate ligament to form an “X”. It is composed of strong fibrous material and assists in controlling excessive motion. This is done by limiting mobility of the joint. The anterior cruciate ligament is one of the four main ligaments of the knee, providing 85% of the restraining force to anterior tibial displacement at 30 degrees and 90 degrees of knee flexion.The ACL is the most injured ligament of the four located in the knee.<br />\n<br />\nAn ACL tear is one of the most common knee injuries, with over 100,000 tears occurring annually in the US.[5] Most ACL tears are a result of a non-contact mechanism such as a sudden change in a direction causing the knee to rotate inward.[6] As the knee rotates inward additional strain is placed on the ACL, since the femur and tibia, which are the two bones that articulate together forming the knee joint, move in opposite directions causing the ACL to tear. Most athletes will require reconstructive surgery on the ACL, in which the torn or ruptured ACL is completely removed and replaced with a piece of tendon or ligament tissue from the patient (autograft) or from a donor (allograft).Conservative treatment has poor outcomes in ACL injury since the ACL is unable to form a fibrous clot as it receives most of its nutrients from the synovial fluid which washes away the reparative cells making it difficult for new fibrous tissue to form..</p>"

Rheumatoid arthritis (C) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease, which produces a symmetrical, deforming polyarthritis.

She was treated for streptococcal throat infection 10 days ago and recently completed antibiotic therapy. She has had some cramping abdominal pain, but she is premenstrual and says the pain is similar to her usual cramps. She took ibuprofen for the pain, with good relief. She has a boyfriend but is not sexually active. She denies previous history of bruising or bleeding easily. Inspection of her legs reveals diffuse tender, erythematous, indurated patches and nodules over the anterior aspects of her tibias bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?</p>"

There is also a risk that the baby born to a mother with these antibodies will develop a condition known as neonatal lupus syndrome. This typically presents with a rash, often a few weeks after birth. The baby's rash may be triggered by sunlight as in women with SLE, so babies born to mothers with lupus and these antibodies should not be placed in sunlight after birth. An affected baby may have mildly abnormal liver function tests and occasionally low platelets as well but this rarely causes bleeding. Neonatal lupus rash and syndrome occurs in the babies of about 1 in 30 women with anti-Ro and/or anti-La antibodies. The condition usually settles by itself without any special treatment except avoiding sunlight over a few weeks, as the baby gradually destroys the antibodies transferred during pregnancy from the mother to the baby.

Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) refers to any uterine bleeding in a menopausal woman (other than the expected cyclic bleeding that occurs in women taking sequential postmenopausal hormone therapy). It accounts for about 5 percent of office gynecology visits <br />\nAll postmenopausal women with unexpected uterine bleeding patients should be evaluated for endometrial carcinoma since this potentially lethal disease will be the cause of bleeding in approximately 10 percent (range 1 to 25 percent, depending upon risk factors). However, the most common cause of bleeding in these women is atrophy of the vaginal mucosa or endometrium. In the early menopausal years, endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and submucosal fibroids are also common etiologies <br />\n<br />\nhttp://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding.</p>"

Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) refers to any uterine bleeding in a menopausal woman (other than the expected cyclic bleeding that occurs in women taking sequential postmenopausal hormone therapy). It accounts for about 5 percent of office gynecology visits <br />\nAll postmenopausal women with unexpected uterine bleeding patients should be evaluated for endometrial carcinoma since this potentially lethal disease will be the cause of bleeding in approximately 10 percent (range 1 to 25 percent, depending upon risk factors). However, the most common cause of bleeding in these women is atrophy of the vaginal mucosa or endometrium. In the early menopausal years, endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and submucosal fibroids are also common etiologies <br />\n<br />\nhttp://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding.</p>"

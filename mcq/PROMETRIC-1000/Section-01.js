A cerebral abscess is one the most dangerous complications that can result From infections affecting the face and any of the routes that allow infection into the brain, such as sinusitis and otitis media. Patients can complain of fever, headaches and seizures among other presentations. In stable patients, pharmacological therapy is dependent on the suspected organism.

Asthma is also considered severe when it is uncontrolled despite proper use of these medications. Individuals who suffer from severe uncontrolled asthma experience symptoms throughout most days and every night. These patients often require the frequent use of inhaled medications or even daily oral steroids to provide rescue from their asthma symptoms. Severe asthma may impact daily activities, resulting in missing work or school, and can directly affect a patient’s quality of life.

This Results in ipsilateral paralysis and loss of light touch and vibration sensation and contralateral loss in pain and temperature below the point of the lesion. The spinothalamic tracts cross at the level of the cord, so sensation to pain and temperature is lost in the contralateral limbs (B). C3,4, 5 keep the diaphragm alive (A), so breathing should be preserved. As the right corticospinal tract has been severed, the right, ipsilateral hand would be paralysed (C) as well as the right leg. The left dorsal columns carry light touch fibres from the left limb (D). They have been unaffected by the injury. C6 is responsible for the biceps reflex and would be lost (E).

They are thought to occur because of an increased sensitivity to the female hormone oestrogen. A fibroadenoma usually has a smooth rubbery texture and can move easily under the skin. Fibroadenomas are usually painless, but some people may feel some tenderness or even pain. Fibroadenomas are very common and it is not unusual to have more than one. Often developing during puberty, they are mostly found in young women, but can occur at any age. Most fibroadenomas are about 1 to 3cm in size and are called simple fibroadenomas. Occasionally, a fibroadenoma can grow to more than 5cm and may be called a giant fibroadenoma. Those found in teenage girls may be called juvenile fibroadenomas. Most fibroadenomas stay the same size. Some get smaller and some eventually disappear over time. Sometimes fibroadenomas get bigger, particularly in teenage girls and pregnant and breastfeeding women, but often get smaller again..</p>"

As they occur in hospital the pathogens involved are very different from those that cause community acquired pneumonia. Gram-negative organisms are far more common due to:A: Colonisation of the oropharynx by Gram-negative bacilli is very common in hospitalised patients – who have often been on broad spectrum antibiotics already B: Increased risk of micro-aspiration of nasopharyngeal secretions C: Patients in hospital often have decreased immune systems Thus antibiotics that will cover such organisms should be instituted, most commonly as a combination therapy.

As they occur in hospital the pathogens involved are very different from those that cause community acquired pneumonia. Gram-negative organisms are far more common due to:A: Colonisation of the oropharynx by Gram-negative bacilli is very common in hospitalised patients – who have often been on broad spectrum antibiotics already B: Increased risk of micro-aspiration of nasopharyngeal secretions C: Patients in hospital often have decreased immune systems Thus antibiotics that will cover such organisms should be instituted, most commonly as a combination therapy.

Wet beriberi affects the cardiovascular system resulting in a fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and leg swelling. Dry beriberi affects the nervous system resulting in numbness of the hands and feet, confusion, trouble moving the legs, and pain.A form with loss of appetite and constipation may also occur.Another type, acute beriberi, is found mostly in babies and presents with loss of appetite, vomiting, lactic acidosis, changes in heart rate, and enlargement of the hear..</p>"

A prolonged APTT (>30–50 s) suggests abnormalities in the<br />\nCommon (factors I, II, V, X) or intrinsic pathway (factors VIII, IX, XI, XII).<br />\nImportantly, factor VII does not cause any anomalies in APTT times. Aprolonged TT suggests fibrinogen deficiency while abnormal bleedingtimes suggest platelet deficiencies. In liver disease (B) the PT, APTT, bleeding time and platelet counts would be abnormal alongside peripheralstigmata of liver disease. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (C) causesabnormalities of PT, APTT, bleeding time and platelets. In congenitalafibrogenaemia (D), the PT, APTT, TT and bleeding times would be abnormalwhile the platelet count would be normal. Glanzmann’s thrombaesthenia (E), a platelet abnormality whereby glycoprotein IIb/IIIa is absent preventingplatelet bridging with fibrinogen, the bleeding time is significantlyprolonged while PT, APTT and platelet counts are normal..</p>"

Cisplatin, as with mostdrug toxicities, would not produce a rise in creatinine for 5 to 10days. Bence-Jones protein and hypercalcemia both cause renalinsufficiency, but it would not be rapid and it would not happen as aresult of treatment.

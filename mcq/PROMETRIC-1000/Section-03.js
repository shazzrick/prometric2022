These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.<br />\n<br />\nEpisodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy)..</p>"

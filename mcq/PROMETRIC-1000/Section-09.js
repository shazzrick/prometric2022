Endoscopy is used to evaluate for erosive gastritis or other complications. The best initial management is a change in feeding technique and thickened feeds.

Symptoms typically resolve by 12–24 months. Diagnosis is clinical. However, the best initial test is esophageal pH monitoring. Endoscopy is used to evaluate for erosive gastritis or other complications. The best initial management is a change in feeding technique and thickened feeds. H2-receptors are considered first line in children because of the safety profile. However, proton pump inhibitors tend to be more effective in suppressing gastric acid production..</p>"

The reference to traveler's diarrhea is a red herring. The grouped ulcers are characteristic of a herpetic infection. The ulcers begin as vesicular lesions and then painfully ulcerate. The perineal region is frequently involved, and the lesions may spread into the anal canal but do not usually cause any evidence of proctosigmoiditis. These symptoms are often accompanied by neuropathic symptoms, as the herpes resides in the dorsal ganglia.<br />\n<br />\nCytomegalovirus infection (choice A) may involve the colon in a severely<br />\nImmunocompromised HIV patient whose CD4 count is less than 50. This man has no evidence of HIV and furthermore has no colitic symptoms. In addition, cytomegalovirus will not cause ulceration on the exterior perianal skin.<br />\n<br />\nGonorrhea (choice C) may be the cause of a sexually transmitted proctitis but will<br />\nPresent with a mucopurulent discharge and perhaps symptoms of mild proctitis but<br />\nWithout ulceration.<br />\n<br />\nShigella dysenteriae (choice D) will present as an invasive type of diarrhea with bloody, mucoid stools and may cause ulceration in the colon or small bowel but does not cause ulcerations in the anal canal or perianal region.<br />\n<br />\nUlcerative colitis (choice E) would have an abnormal sigmoidoscopic appearance and present with bloody diarrhea.

The risk of acquiring hepatitis B is significantly higher than the risk for HIV, and somewhat higher than the risk for hepatitis C. Thus, it is essential that health care workers be immunized against the hepatitis B virus. The immunization schedule is for administration of the vaccine at 1, 2, and 6 months. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that postvaccination testing for antibodies be performed to identify an adequate response to the immunization.

Boerhaave syndrome is a full-thickness tear of the esophagus secondary to retching. The patient will have a history of severe incessant vomiting, often due to alcoholism. MI is unlikely in this patient given the subcutaneous emphysema. The other choices do not have substernal chest pain.

                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Correct!</p><p>Correct answer is A : Inhibit cycloxgenase<br/>A.Aspirin causes several different effects in the body, mainly the reduction of inflammation, analgesia (relief of pain), the prevention of clotting, and the reduction of fever. Much of this is believed to be due to decreased production of prostaglandins and TXA2. Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. Cyclooxygenase is required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the COX enzyme.[1] This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen), which are reversible inhibitors. However, other effects of aspirin, such as uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, and the modulation of signaling through NF-?B, are also being investigated. Some of its effects are like those of salicylic acid, which is not an acetylating agent..</p>"

                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Nope!</p><p>Correct answer is A : Inhibit cycloxgenase<br/>A.Aspirin causes several different effects in the body, mainly the reduction of inflammation, analgesia (relief of pain), the prevention of clotting, and the reduction of fever. Much of this is believed to be due to decreased production of prostaglandins and TXA2. Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. Cyclooxygenase is required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the COX enzyme.[1] This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen), which are reversible inhibitors. However, other effects of aspirin, such as uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, and the modulation of signaling through NF-?B, are also being investigated. Some of its effects are like those of salicylic acid, which is not an acetylating agent..</p>"

Pilonidal cyst is an acute or chronic abscess of the sacrococcygeal region arising from an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Risk factors include poor hygiene, obesity, and the presence of a deep natal cleft. When a person with these risk factors sits or bends, the natal cleft stretches, damaging or breaking hair follicles and opening a pore, or “pit,” which collects debris (roots of hairs shed from the head, back, or buttocks). As movement draws the skin taut over the natal cleft, it createsnegativepressure in the subcutaneous space that draws hair deeper into the pore, and the friction generates a sinus.<br />\nTreatment is with incision and drainage.

                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Correct!</p><p>Correct answer is B : Bupropion<br/>All patients should be screened for tobacco use and advised against it. The most effective method of achieving smoking cessation is the use of oral medication, such as bupropion and varenicline. Less effective therapies that can be tried first are nicotine patches and gums.<br />\n<br />\nBupropion does not contain nicotine and does not help you quit smoking in the same way that nicotine replacement therapy does. But like other medicines, it decreases cravings and withdrawal symptoms . ... You take bupropion for 7 to 12 weeks after you stop using tobacco. You can take it for as long as 6 months to a year.<br />\n<br />\nBupropion is an effective pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation (Ludvig et al 2005; Ross et al 2005) and should be considered as a first line agent along with NRT alone or in combination (Mansourati et al 2005). Both pragmatic observational trials and explanatory randomized trials of bupropion therapy have shown approximately 1 in 5 smokers will successfully remain abstinent from smoking at one year (Hurt et al 1997; Jorenby et al 1999; Tonnesen et al 2003; Tonstad et al 2003; Zellweger et al 2005; Wilkes et al 2005; Paluck et al 2006). Varenicline is also considered as a first line pharmacotherapy for motivated smokers expressing a desire to stop smoking (Frishman 2007; NICE 2007; Nides et al 2007). Varenicline’s initial higher quit rate compared to bupropion tails off to similar rates between the two drugs at one year (Gonzales et al 2006; Jorenby et al 2006; Oncken et al 2006; Tonstad et al 2006). Nortriptyline and clonidine have proven efficacy for smoking cessation and are considered as second line agents for smoking cessation (McRobbie et al 2005). There is no evidence to support prolonged bupropion therapy beyond its current license of 7 to 9 weeks and any decision to limit re-treatment is purely a pragmatic one (Killen et al 2006). NICE recommend re-treatment after a period of six months (NICE 2002). Also there is only limited evidence that bupropion therapy has a modifying effect upon withdrawal and craving following cessation of treatment (Warner et al 2005).<br />\n<br />\nThe next steps in smoking cessation strategies for many countries are the introduction of smoking bans in public places. Bupropion, varenicline and NRT will however continue to play a significant part in helping smokers to quit. Pharmacotherapies alone will not confer successful smoking cessation; psychological support and personal motivation as well as modifying environmental factors are paramount to successful smoking cessation.<br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528204/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528204/</a>.</p>"

                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Nope!</p><p>Correct answer is B : Bupropion<br/>All patients should be screened for tobacco use and advised against it. The most effective method of achieving smoking cessation is the use of oral medication, such as bupropion and varenicline. Less effective therapies that can be tried first are nicotine patches and gums.<br />\n<br />\nBupropion does not contain nicotine and does not help you quit smoking in the same way that nicotine replacement therapy does. But like other medicines, it decreases cravings and withdrawal symptoms . ... You take bupropion for 7 to 12 weeks after you stop using tobacco. You can take it for as long as 6 months to a year.<br />\n<br />\nBupropion is an effective pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation (Ludvig et al 2005; Ross et al 2005) and should be considered as a first line agent along with NRT alone or in combination (Mansourati et al 2005). Both pragmatic observational trials and explanatory randomized trials of bupropion therapy have shown approximately 1 in 5 smokers will successfully remain abstinent from smoking at one year (Hurt et al 1997; Jorenby et al 1999; Tonnesen et al 2003; Tonstad et al 2003; Zellweger et al 2005; Wilkes et al 2005; Paluck et al 2006). Varenicline is also considered as a first line pharmacotherapy for motivated smokers expressing a desire to stop smoking (Frishman 2007; NICE 2007; Nides et al 2007). Varenicline’s initial higher quit rate compared to bupropion tails off to similar rates between the two drugs at one year (Gonzales et al 2006; Jorenby et al 2006; Oncken et al 2006; Tonstad et al 2006). Nortriptyline and clonidine have proven efficacy for smoking cessation and are considered as second line agents for smoking cessation (McRobbie et al 2005). There is no evidence to support prolonged bupropion therapy beyond its current license of 7 to 9 weeks and any decision to limit re-treatment is purely a pragmatic one (Killen et al 2006). NICE recommend re-treatment after a period of six months (NICE 2002). Also there is only limited evidence that bupropion therapy has a modifying effect upon withdrawal and craving following cessation of treatment (Warner et al 2005).<br />\n<br />\nThe next steps in smoking cessation strategies for many countries are the introduction of smoking bans in public places. Bupropion, varenicline and NRT will however continue to play a significant part in helping smokers to quit. Pharmacotherapies alone will not confer successful smoking cessation; psychological support and personal motivation as well as modifying environmental factors are paramount to successful smoking cessation.<br />\n<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528204/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528204/</a>.</p>"

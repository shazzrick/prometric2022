Patients thereforesuffer from symptoms that include dehydration, depression, bone andabdominalpain and increased risk of renal stones. Although the underlyingdisease is multiple myeloma, the patient must first be stabilized against theeffects of hypercalcaemia. Intravenous saline (E) over several days stabilizesthe patient and replaces any lost fluid volume. Calcitonin (A) has a shortduration of action and is not particularly effective in lowering calciumlevels and would not help with the patient’s fluid loss.

It is unlikely to be a pseudoseizure (E) (psychogenic nonepilepticseizure) and patients must be investigated with telemetry beforebeing given this diagnosis. Insufficient sleep and stress can trigger seizures.<br />\nThe witness gives a good description of tonic–clonic seizures (A) which are a type of generalized seizure (B). Other types of generalized seizuresinclude absence, tonic and atonic. The old name for tonic–clonic seizuresis grand mal (C) (petit mal are now known as absence seizures). They maybe primary or secondary. In this case there is secondary generalization asthe patient describes an aura herald.

It is unlikely to be a pseudoseizure (E) (psychogenic nonepilepticseizure) and patients must be investigated with telemetry beforebeing given this diagnosis. Insufficient sleep and stress can trigger seizures.<br />\nThe witness gives a good description of tonic–clonic seizures (A) which are a type of generalized seizure (B).

Diabetic nephropathy may be functionally silent for 10 to 15 years. Clinically detectable diabetic nephropathy begins with the development of microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg of albumin per 24 h). The glomerular filtration rate actually may be elevated at this stage. Only after the passage of additional time will the proteinuria be overt enough (0.5 g/L) to be detectable on standard urine dipsticks. Microalbuminuria precedes nephropathy in patients with both non-insulin- dependent and insulin-dependent diabetes. An increase in kidney size also may accompany the initial hyperfiltration stage. Once the proteinuria becomes significant enough to be detected by dipstick, a steady decline in renal function occurs, with the glomerular filtration rate falling an average of 1 mL per minute per month. Therefore, azotemia begins about 12 years after the diagnosis of diabetes. Hypertension clearly is an exacerbating factor for diabetic nephropathy..</p>"

This change is considered to be a premalignant condition because it is associated with a high incidence of further transition to esophageal adenocarcinoma, an often-deadly cancer.[1][2] <br />\nThe main cause of Barrett's esophagus is thought to be an adaptation to chronic acid exposure from reflux esophagitis.[3] Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed by endoscopy: observing the characteristic appearance of this condition by direct inspection of the lower esophagus; followed by microscopic examination of tissue from the affected area obtained from biopsy. The cells of Barrett's esophagus are classified into four categories: nondysplastic, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and frank carcinoma. High-grade dysplasia and early stages of adenocarcinoma may be treated by endoscopic resection or radiofrequency ablation.[4] Later stages of adenocarcinoma may be treated with surgical resection or palliation. Those with nondysplastic or low-grade dysplasia are managed by annual observation with endoscopy, or treatment with radiofrequency ablation. In high-grade dysplasia, the risk of developing cancer might be at 10% per patient-year or greater.[1] <br />\nThe incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased substantially in the Western world in recent years.[1] The condition is found in 5–15% of patients who seek medical care for heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD), although a large subgroup of patients with Barrett's esophagus are asymptomatic. The condition is named after surgeon Norman Barrett (1903–1979). Despite this, the condition was originally described by Philip Rowland Allison in 1946.</p>"

The most appropriatetreatment here is to start the patient on high dose oral prednisolone (C).This is especially important in this case as the patient is describing visualloss. The patient must then be followed up with a temporal artery biopsywithin the next 3–4 days to confirm the diagnosis. Paracetamol alone (A)<br />\nmay provide some symptomatic relief but will not alter the underlyingvasculitic process, thus loss of vision may occur. Intravenous hydrocortisone(B) is not required, as the patient can have the steroid treatment asprednisolone orally. A CT head (D) is not useful as the underlying vasculiticprocess cannot be visualized. Opthalmology opinion (E) can be sought butthe most important immediate management is to give the oral steroids..</p>"

CJD is interesting as the causative<br />\nagent is a simple protein (not a virus or bacteria, like other infectious<br />\ndiseases). The incidence is tiny – one in a million per year. Although there<br />\nhas been a large scare in transmission of this disease, especially the variant<br />\nform, most cases of this very rare disease occur spontaneously in a person<br />\nwithout any risk factors. Hereditary transmission (B) is the second most<br />\ncommon cause with a clear genetic component. Blood transfusion, corneal<br />\ntransplant or surgery with contaminated instruments or human pituitary<br />\nhormone replacement therapy has all been implicated in iatrogenic CJD<br />\n (D), but the actual risk of this is very low. Cannibalism (E) is the classic<br />\nexample of transmission. This type of CJD, Kuru, was seen in the Fore tribe<br />\nof Papua New Guinea where in burial ceremonies, the women would eat<br />\nthe deceased’s brain and be exposed to the prion protein. Men who<br />\ntraditionally did not eat the brain as part of the ceremony were spared. The<br />\nprofile of CJD was greatly raised with the mad cow disease scandal. The<br />\nworry here was that humans were contracting the disease from contaminated<br />\nmeat, which meant that the causative prion had crossed the species barrier.<br />\nThis, coupled to the high exposure of the population to meat and the long<br />\n(around ten years) incubation time, led to speculation of a future pandemic.<br />\nThis has not materialized and the number of cases of variant CJD is<br />\nextremely small, albeit tragic..</p>"

CJD is interesting as the causative<br />\nagent is a simple protein (not a virus or bacteria, like other infectious<br />\ndiseases). The incidence is tiny – one in a million per year. Although there<br />\nhas been a large scare in transmission of this disease, especially the variant<br />\nform, most cases of this very rare disease occur spontaneously in a person<br />\nwithout any risk factors. Hereditary transmission (B) is the second most<br />\ncommon cause with a clear genetic component. Blood transfusion, corneal<br />\ntransplant or surgery with contaminated instruments or human pituitary<br />\nhormone replacement therapy has all been implicated in iatrogenic CJD<br />\n (D), but the actual risk of this is very low. Cannibalism (E) is the classic<br />\nexample of transmission. This type of CJD, Kuru, was seen in the Fore tribe<br />\nof Papua New Guinea where in burial ceremonies, the women would eat<br />\nthe deceased’s brain and be exposed to the prion protein. Men who<br />\ntraditionally did not eat the brain as part of the ceremony were spared. The<br />\nprofile of CJD was greatly raised with the mad cow disease scandal. The<br />\nworry here was that humans were contracting the disease from contaminated<br />\nmeat, which meant that the causative prion had crossed the species barrier.<br />\nThis, coupled to the high exposure of the population to meat and the long<br />\n(around ten years) incubation time, led to speculation of a future pandemic.<br />\nThis has not materialized and the number of cases of variant CJD is<br />\nextremely small, albeit tragic..</p>"

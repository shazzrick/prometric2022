Acute diverticulitis has an acute onset of severe abdominal pain that is most likely located in the lower left quadrant.

The real take-home message with this case is to evaluate the child for the underlying cause of the sepsis. Understanding he has had a febrile seizure is only the surface of the case. A full sepsis evaluation must be ordered, which includes CBC with differential blood and urine cultures, urinalysis, chest x-ray, and lumbar puncture (if irritability or lethargy is mentioned = meningitis).

On examination of the perianal area, there is a group of five clustered ulcers adjacent to the anal orifice and extending into the anal canal. A sigmoidoscopy reveals normal rectosigmoid mucosa.

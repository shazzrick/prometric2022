An abdominal ultrasound scan (A) is the optimal investigation for gallstones and can reveal pancreatic swelling from pancreatitis. A CT scan (B) is important to investigate pancreatic necrosis, although this usually occurs in severe or recurrent attacks, it is also useful in differentiating between pancreatic carcinoma and chronic pancreatitis. Once a diagnosis has been made, a CT scan is appropriate to determine the next step in management. An MRI scan (E) is more often used in chronic pancreatitis sufferers as often more detailed information can be acquired,such as changes in an already diseased pancreas. Rarely, in other gastrointestinal disorders, e.g. perforated peptic ulcer disease, the serum amylase can be elevated enough (&gt;600) to overlap with pancreatitis. For this reason, an erect chest x-ray (C) can help exclude such causes of pain and amylase elevation. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (D) is often used in emergency situations, e.g. stone impaction in the common bile duct causing worsening symptoms of liver and pancreas.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammation of the pancreas, with over 90% caused by alcoholism and cholelithiasis.&nbsp;</strong></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Pancreatitis: a </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">stone</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">a stricture</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">a tumor</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">and obstruction&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">Less common causes of acute pancreatitis include: </strong></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Trauma </strong></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Hypertriglyceridemia </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Hypercalcemia </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Infection </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Drug toxicity (pentamidine, didanosine, azathioprine, estrogens) </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Drug allergy (sulfa drugs such as furosemide and </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">hydrochlorothiazide</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">) </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Ductal obstruction, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">(ERCP), cystic fibrosis </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Scorpion sting&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">Presentation/“What Is the Most Likely Diagnosis?” </strong></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Acute epigastric </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">pain </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">+ </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">tenderness </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">+ nausea/</span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">vomiting </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">= </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">pancreatitis </strong></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In severe cases there is hypotension and fever.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">Diagnostic Tests </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">best initial tests </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">are amylase and lipase. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">most specific test </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">is CT scan</span></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">Treatment </strong></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">NPO (no food) </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">IV hydration at very high volume </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Analgesia </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">PPIs decrease pancreatic stimulation from acid entering the duodenum </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">If there is more than </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">30% necrosis on CT </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">or MRI, </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">adding antibiotics such as </strong></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">imipenem or meropenem </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">may decrease mortality by decreasing the </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">development of infected, necrotic pancreatitis.

This results in a number of dangerous complications including mediastinal shift away from the site of the pneumothorax including heart and associated vessels, collapse of the lung on the affected side and compression of the opposite lung. Patients appear clinically unwell and associated signs include a progressive hypoxic and hypercapnoeic state, tachycardia, late hypotension and hyper-resonance on chest percussion which does not occur in answers (B) to (E). A chest x-ray is helpful in confirming the clinical signs, a needle thoracostomy provides emergency treatment until a chest drain can be inserted for more definitive management. Pneumonia (B) is the inflammation of the lung tissue most often due to a bacterial infection. Patients typically present with fever, cough, pleuritic pain and purulent sputum. Clinical signs include that of lung consolidation with dullness on percussion. A pleural effusion (C) is excess fluid that surrounds the lung due to a number of causes, such as heart failure and liver failure. The excess fluid can impair lung expansion and typically patients have a stony dullness to percussion. An aortic dissection (D) is often precipitated by hypertension causing a tear into the arterial intima, this is expanded by blood penetration and can involve the aortic arch or descending thoracic aorta. Patients complain of a severe ‘tearing’ pain that begins in the chest and radiates to the back. A pulmonary embolism (E) is a dislodged thrombus which usually originates in the venous system and travels to the pulmonary vasculature. Symptoms typically include abrupt shortness of breath and as further lung damage and infarction ensues, haemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain can occur.</p>.</p>"

Blood tests reveal a mild hyponatraemia while blood<br />\npressure is 110/82. The most likely diagnosis is:</p>"

Transmission occurs through the bite of the <span style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">female anopheline mosquito. </span>The incidence of malaria is strongly affected by the appropriate environmental temperature which influences the temperature-dependent development of the parasite in the mosquito gut. Sporozoites, the infective stage of the plasmodium, accumulate in the salivary glands of the mosquito and enter the bloodstream when a human is bitten. Rapid uptake occurs in the liver whereby the sporozoites undergo rapid multiplication as merozoites.<span style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\"> P. vivax and P. ovale often remain dormant in the liver as hypnozoites</span> reactivating at a later date. The other infected hepatocyte cells rupture releasing merozoites into the bloodstream where they are taken up by erythrocyte cells. The merozoites again undergo cyclic multiplication transforming from merozoites to trophozoites to schizonts and then back to mature merozoites. At this stage, the erythrocytes rupture releasing new merozoites to infect fresh erythrocytes. This follows a tertian cycle (48 hours) in P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. ovale, while P. falciparum follows a quartan cycle (72 hours), although this more often occurs in more longstanding disease. In P. vivax (B) or P. ovale (D), infection symptoms tend to be relatively mild, with a slower progression of anaemia and recovery within 6 weeks. However, hypnozoites may reactivate years after initial infection. P. malariae (C) is similarly mild in progression but is much more chronic and can last for years. P. falciparum (A) infection is distinguishable by its high parasitaemia which can cause mental state changes while elevated cytokines can cause end stage organ damage. P. knowlesi (E) is a new malarial infection in humans and can cause severe malarial symptoms. Its asexual cycle lasts around 24 hours with a typical fever following a quotidian/daily cycle.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum\" target=\"_blank\">Plasmodium falciparum - Wikipedia</a></p>.</p>"

Transmission occurs through the bite of the <span style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">female anopheline mosquito. </span>The incidence of malaria is strongly affected by the appropriate environmental temperature which influences the temperature-dependent development of the parasite in the mosquito gut.

The<br />\nsyndrome is precipitated shortly after use of serotonin-based medications<br />\nsuch as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Progressive<br />\nsymptoms, atrial fibrillation and weight loss do not usually occur..</p>"

The<br />\ncavernous sinuses are irregular cavities at the base of the skull lying either<br />\nside of the sella turcica. Blood enters from multiple directions into the<br />\ncavernous sinus including the facial veins, sphenoid and middle cerebral<br />\nveins. Any infection of the face may therefore enter the nose or tonsils and<br />\nspread into the cavernous sinus with disastrous consequences. The third,<br />\nfourth and sixth cranial nerves are in close proximity while the ophthalmic<br />\nand maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve are also adjacent to the<br />\nsinus wall. A cavernous sinus thrombosis therefore presents with an<br />\nassortment of headache, orbital pain, eye swelling and cranial nerve<br />\npalsies affecting III, IV, VI and part of V. A giant cell arteritis (B) is an<br />\ninflammatory granulomatous disease which typically affects the large<br />\ncerebral arteries. Symptoms can include severe headaches, scalp and skull<br />\ntenderness. In severe cases temporary or permanent loss of vision in one<br />\neye can occur due to ophthalmic artery involvement.

A blood culture (B) would not be appropriate as the patient does not have any features of meningism or infection. Fundoscopy (D) may support cerebral changes, such as papilloedema, due to raised intracranial pressure which would negate a lumbar puncture, however, since a CT scan is first-line investigation it is not appropriate in this case.</p>.</p>"

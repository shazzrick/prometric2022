The normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm</span>, but some people just normally have a heart rate that is &lt;60 bpm. Bradycardia can also be the initial presentation of third-degree or “complete” heart block. An EKG is mandatory to distinguish the cause of bradycardia. The most common wrong answer is “do nothing.” If you confirm that this is an asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, then the answer is “reassurance” or “do nothing.” Atropine is the answer for an acutely symptomatic patient with signs of hypoperfusion. Pacemaker is used for all patients with third- degree AV block. Epinephrine is dangerous, especially since ischemia is such a common cause of bradycardia. Isoproterenol is an old, rarely used nonspecific beta agonist that speeds up the heart rate but increases ischemia.</p>.</p>"

The normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm</span>, but some people just normally have a heart rate that is &lt;60 bpm. Bradycardia can also be the initial presentation of third-degree or “complete” heart block. An EKG is mandatory to distinguish the cause of bradycardia. The most common wrong answer is “do nothing.” If you confirm that this is an asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, then the answer is “reassurance” or “do nothing.” Atropine is the answer for an acutely symptomatic patient with signs of hypoperfusion. Pacemaker is used for all patients with third- degree AV block. Epinephrine is dangerous, especially since ischemia is such a common cause of bradycardia. Isoproterenol is an old, rarely used nonspecific beta agonist that speeds up the heart rate but increases ischemia.</p>.</p>"

In the management of foreign object obstruction, if the patient can cough and breathe, it is best to initially observe and allow spontaneous resolution, since intervention may actually be damaging.<br />\nOften, blind finger sweeps (choice B) may remove the foreign object and resolve thesymptoms. Also, this will need to be done if the patient is to be intubated. The next step would be performing back blows if the patient was less than 1 year of age<br />\n(choice C).If the patient were over 1 year old, abdominal thrusts would be the next management<br />\noption(choice D).An emergency tracheostomy (choice E) should be the last option and should be undertaken only by a physician trained to perform the procedure..</p>"

Oxygen does not make a specific difference. Gastric emptying is not as useful as a specific antidote and should only be used if it is very clear that the overdose occurred during the last hour. When you have an acute change in mental status, hypoglycemia is a very common cause, as is an opiate overdose. On a CCS case, give naloxone, thiamine, and dextrose and give oxygen and saline while checking the toxicology screen?all at the same time..</p>"

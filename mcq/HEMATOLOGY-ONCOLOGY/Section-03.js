Therefore, answer (B) is incorrect. Small cell carcinomas account for 20â€“30 per cent of bronchial cancers, while the rest are non-small cell carcinomas. Of these, squamous cell carcinomas are the most common. Therefore, answer (C) is incorrect. Answer (D) is incorrect as cigarette smoking is the most significant aetiological factor in the development of bronchial cancers.Finally, small cell carcinomas usually arise from the peri-hilar region of the lung. Adenocarcinomas occur more commonly in the periphery. Thus,answer (E) is also incorrect..</p>"

Pain<br />\nrelief should follow the WHOs pain relief ladder, where strong opioids, such<br />\nas morphine, are started for pain that is not relieved by non-opioid and<br />\nweak opioid pain relief. To begin with, opiate-naive patients can be started<br />\non oral morphine solution, 5â€“10 mg every 4 hours. Breakthrough pain<br />\nbetween these regular doses must be rescued by an equal dose of oral<br />\nmorphine solution as required. Once a 24-hour requirement of morphine<br />\nis established, the dose can be given as a modified release preparation<br />\n(morphine sulphate tablets) in two divided doses. A sixth of the total daily<br />\nmorphine dose should be given as required (used a maximum of every 4<br />\nhours) for breakthrough pain. The patient in the question has used 60 mg<br />\nof oral morphine solution in 24 hours.

However, blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract is the most common cause in men and postmenopausal women. Therefore, the case outlined in this question should raise the suspicion of a gastrointestinal cancer, such as gastric or colonic carcinoma.

                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Correct!</p><p>Correct answer is C : Carcinoid syndrome<br/>Carcinoid tumours arise from enterochromaffin cells (APUD cells). They most commonly occur in the appendix, ileum or rectum but can occur elsewhere, including other areas of the gastrointestinal tract, ovary, testis or lung. It is often difficult to histologically determine whether carcinoid tumours are benign or malignant. Carcinoid tumours (B) of the gastrointestinal tract are usually asymptomatic but may cause appendicitis, intussusception or obstruction. Carcinoid syndrome (C) refers to carcinoid tumours with liver metastases. These patients are usually symptomatic and may present with spontaneous facial flushing, abdominal pain and watery diarrhoea. Fifty per cent of patients develop cardiac abnormalities, such as tricuspid regurgitation or pulmonary stenosis. Symptoms are produced by the tumours secreting substances such as 5- ydroxytryptamine, bradykinin and histamine. Investigations for carcinoid syndrome should include radiological imaging of the liver metastases and 24-hour urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. While facial flushing may be seen in superior vena cava obstruction (A), the other features are not seen, making this an unlikely diagnosis. Phaeochromocytomaâ€™s (D) are catecholamine-producing tumours, usually of the adrenal medulla. Patients present with features of catecholamine overload such as uncontrolled, episodic hypertension.Connâ€™s syndrome (E) are aldosterone producing adenomas which may present with features of hypokalaemia, polyuria or polydipsia..</p>"

The blood group type denotes the antigens that are present on the patient’s red blood cells but also the opposing antibodies the patient has in their plasma. A patient who is blood group A (AA or AO) will have group A antigens on their red blood cells but anti-B antibodies. Similarly, a patient who is blood group B (BB or BO) will have group B antigens on their red blood cells but anti-A antibodies. If this patient were group B negative then giving group A negative blood (E) would cause a potentially fatal crossreaction.<br />\nGroup AB patients have no opposing antibodies in their plasma while group O patients have anti-A and anti-B. In this emergency scenario, since the next of kin is unsure of the patient’s blood type, the safest blood group to give is group O negative (D). The O negative blood will have no antigens for the patient’s immune system to potentially react with and there is no danger of rhesus sensitization which would occur in group O positive blood (A). If the patient were indeed group B negative, then B negative blood (C) would be the safest blood type to give.

The blood test values show a normocytic anaemia, normal platelet count and serum iron, increased ferritin concentration and reduced total iron binding capacity (TIBC). In anaemia of chronic disease, an underlying disease causes an inflammatory process involving cytokines to occur. Factors such as CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are raised. The effect of these cytokines is to interrupt the homeostasis of iron. Erythropoietin is inhibited, iron is unable to flow out of red blood cells, ferritin production is increased and RBC death is increased.

By definition, in iron-deficiency anaemia (B), the serum iron is reduced as well as the MCV, which is not the case here, there is also an increase in the TIBC. In anaemia of chronic disease, protein production can be reduced such that this increase does not occur.

The impact of these actions causes anaemia with raised ferritin levels and, if prolonged, serum iron is also eventually reduced. By definition, in iron-deficiency anaemia (B), the serum iron is reduced as well as the MCV, which is not the case here, there is also an increase in the TIBC. In anaemia of chronic disease, protein production can be reduced such that this increase does not occur. A macrocytic anaemia (D) would be accompanied by an increased MCV while aplastic anaemia (E) is unlikely in light of the normal platelet and white blood cell count. In thalassaemia, the haemoglobin and MCV are reduced but serum iron, ferritin and transferrin can be normal.</p>.</p>"

In this case vitamin B12 and folic acid are less likely to be important given the patient’s diet, however tea is alkaline and reduces the body’s ability to effectively absorb iron. Measuring the patient’s serum ferritin (B) provides an accurate reflection of the body’s iron stores since the serum ferritin originates from the storage pools in the bone marrow, spleen and liver. Be aware that ferritin measurements are only accurate when CRP is normal since both ferritin and CRP are acute phase reactants. The serum transferrin (C) level reflects the levels of protein that bind to iron and transports it around the body and is usually 33 per cent saturated, hence not providing the most accurate level of iron. The serum iron level (E) is a poor reflection of iron stores since this can change dependent on disease states. In iron deficiency anaemia, the serum iron and iron stores are low, however in anaemia of chronic disease iron stores are increased yet the serum iron level is reduced. The total iron binding capacity (D) specifically saturates transferrin in order to measure the iron-carrying capacity in the body rather than iron stores and so would not be appropriate here.

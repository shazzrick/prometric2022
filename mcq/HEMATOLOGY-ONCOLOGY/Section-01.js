A diagnosis of factor XIII may be suspected in infants that experience heavy or abnormal bleeding at birth.<br />\n<br />\nFactor XIII deficiency is a rare, genetic bleeding disorder characterized by deficiency of clotting factor XIII. Clotting factors are specialized proteins that are essential for the blood to clot properly. Specifically, individuals with factor XIII deficiency form blood clots like normal, but these clots are unstable and often break down, resulting in prolonged, uncontrolled bleeding episodes. Factor XIII also affects other processes in the body and is known to play a role in proper wound healing and pregnancy. The severity of factor XIII deficiency bleeds can vary greatly from one person to another. Some individuals may have only mild symptoms; other individuals may have severe, life-threatening bleeds. With early diagnosis and prompt treatment, the more serious bleeds of factor XIII deficiency can be avoided. FXIII consists of two subunits: subunit A and subunit B.

When the story suggests B12 deficiency and the B12 level is equivocal, use an increased MMA level to confirm the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency.<br />\n<br />\nTested facts about macrocytic anemia:<br />\n-Schilling test is never the right answer.<br />\n-Pernicious anemia is confirmed with anti-intrinsic factor and antiparietal cell antibodies.<br />\n-Red blood cells are destroyed as they leave the marrow, so the<br />\nreticulocyte count is low.<br />\n-B12 and folate deficiency can cause pancytopenia as well as macrocytic anemia.<br />\n-Pancreatic enzymes are needed to absorb B12. They free it from carrier proteins.<br />\n-Neurological abnormalities will improve as long as they are minor (e.g., peripheral) and of short duration.<br />\n<br />\nTIPS-B12 can give either neurological or hematological abnormalities alone.<br />\nYou do not have to have both..</p>"

These episodes occur when sickled cells obstruct blood vessels. The degree of pain may range from a mild discomfort to a severe disabling pain where the person needs treatment in hospital. A drop in body fluid levels promotes and sustains the sickling process. Routine treatment includes the use of drugs to relieve pain and the maintenance of adequate fluid levels. Fluid levels will fall if insufficient fluids are taken in compared to the amount of fluid lost. The kidneys of people with sickle cell disease do not concentrate urine properly, which results in poor control of bodily fluids. Additional fluids are given to try and slow or stop the sickling process which should reduce the amount and duration of pain. Fluids may be given in many ways, but orally or intravenously are most common. Fluids should be given with care so as to prevent fluid overload which may in turn cause adverse events such as heart failure or fluid building up in the lungs.

It is diagnosed when a person develops more than 100 adenomatous colon polyps. An adenomatous polyp is an area where normal cells that line the inside of a personâs colon form a mass on the inside of the intestinal tract. The average age for polyps to develop in people with FAP is in the mid-teens. More than 95% of people with FAP will have multiple colon polyps by age 35. If FAP is not recognized and treated, there is almost a 100% chance that a person will develop colorectal cancer<br />\nWhat causes classic FAP?<br />\nFAP is passed from generation to generation in a family. The APC gene is linked to FAP; APC stands foradenomatous polyposis coli.

Tumors which do not penetrate the full thickness of the bowel wall and which have not spread to local regional lymph nodes (T1-2N0M0, modified Astler-Coller Dukes stages A and B1) typically have in excess of a 90% cure rate with surgery alone [4], and postoperative therapy is not routinely recommended. It is in the higher-risk tumors with either full thickness penetration of the bowel wall (T3-4N0M0, modified Astler-Coller Dukes B2-3, stage II) and/or local regional lymph node involvement (TanyN1-2M0, modified Astler-Coller Dukes C, stage III) that the risk of recurrent disease increases, and adjuvant therapy is potentially indicated. <br />\n<br />\nAdjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer, although far from satisfactory, has been clearly shown to reduce the incidence of recurrence and to save lives..</p>"

Tumors which do not penetrate the full thickness of the bowel wall and which have not spread to local regional lymph nodes (T1-2N0M0, modified Astler-Coller Dukes stages A and B1) typically have in excess of a 90% cure rate with surgery alone [4], and postoperative therapy is not routinely recommended. It is in the higher-risk tumors with either full thickness penetration of the bowel wall (T3-4N0M0, modified Astler-Coller Dukes B2-3, stage II) and/or local regional lymph node involvement (TanyN1-2M0, modified Astler-Coller Dukes C, stage III) that the risk of recurrent disease increases, and adjuvant therapy is potentially indicated. <br />\n<br />\nAdjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer, although far from satisfactory, has been clearly shown to reduce the incidence of recurrence and to save lives..</p>"

For example, tetracyclines tend to work well for rosacea, not only because of the antibiotic effect, but because tetracyclines tend to decrease the viscosity of naturally secreted oils, thereby reducing the oil gland \"plugging\" that occurs with this disease. Most eye doctors will prescribe long-acting tetracyclines such as doxycycline, which can be taken once or twice a day. Furthermore, doxycycline, unlike traditional tetracycline, can be taken with food and milk products without preventing absorption in the body..</p>"

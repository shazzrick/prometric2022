                    "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Correct!</p><p>Correct answer is A : Topical retinoid therapy<br/>Psoriasis, one of the most common dermatological presentations, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by the presence of well-defined, erythematous plaques with silvery scales, usually present on the extensor surfaces of the elbows, knees, scalp and sacrum. Plaques, without silvery scales, may be present on flexures (e.g. axillae, groin).Associated signs, which may be present, include nail changes, Kobner phenomenon (lesions appearing along sites of traumatic skin injury),<br />\nAuspitz sign (pinpoint bleeding when scale removed) and systemic signs such as arthropathy (e.g. asymmetrical oligomonoarthritis, arthropathy of the distal interphalangeal joints (DIPs), rheumatoid-like sero-negative polyarthritis, arthritis mutilans and psoriatic spondylitis).<br />\nManagement is targeted at disease control and includes:<br />\n• education;<br />\n• stress and alcohol avoidance;<br />\n• topical drugs are regarded as the mainstay of therapy (e.g. tar,<br />\ndithranol, vitamin D analogues, topical steroid and antibiotic/fungal<br />\ntreatment is beneficial in flexural disease).<br />\nFor psoriasis that is not responsive to conventional therapy (also known as relcalcitrant psoriasis), topical retinoids, phototherapy, oral drugs (e.g.methotrexate, cyclosporin, acitretin, hydroxycarbamide) may be considered.Parenteral cytokine inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies may be considered for recalcitrant psoriasis unresponsive to systemic therapy mentioned<br />\nabove.<br />\nThe question states that the patient is unresponsive to conventional therapy.<br />\nTherefore, the next step would be to consider topical retinoid therapy..</p>"

Plaques, without silvery scales, may be present on flexures (e.g. axillae, groin).Associated signs, which may be present, include nail changes, Kobner phenomenon (lesions appearing along sites of traumatic skin injury),<br />\nAuspitz sign (pinpoint bleeding when scale removed) and systemic signs such as arthropathy (e.g. asymmetrical oligomonoarthritis, arthropathy of the distal interphalangeal joints (DIPs), rheumatoid-like sero-negative polyarthritis, arthritis mutilans and psoriatic spondylitis).<br />\nManagement is targeted at disease control and includes:<br />\n• education;<br />\n• stress and alcohol avoidance;<br />\n• topical drugs are regarded as the mainstay of therapy (e.g. tar,<br />\ndithranol, vitamin D analogues, topical steroid and antibiotic/fungal<br />\ntreatment is beneficial in flexural disease).<br />\nFor psoriasis that is not responsive to conventional therapy (also known as relcalcitrant psoriasis), topical retinoids, phototherapy, oral drugs (e.g.methotrexate, cyclosporin, acitretin, hydroxycarbamide) may be considered.Parenteral cytokine inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies may be considered for recalcitrant psoriasis unresponsive to systemic therapy mentioned<br />\nabove.<br />\nThe question states that the patient is unresponsive to conventional therapy.<br />\nTherefore, the next step would be to consider topical retinoid therapy..</p>"

                    "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Correct!</p><p>Correct answer is C : Bowen’s disease<br/>Bowen’s disease (C) is a form of intra-epidermal carcinoma in situ, which<br />\nmay, if untreated, but rarely, progresses to invasive squamous carcinoma. The<br />\ncondition presents as a solitary, scaling, erythematous plaque which usually<br />\nappears on the trunk. It is usually mistaken for a patch of psoriasis and is<br />\nfrequently treated as the latter. Seborrhoeic keratosis (A) is a condition of<br />\nunknown aetiology characterized by a benign proliferation of epidermal<br />\nkeratinocytes which do not progress to malignancy. Lesions are raised and<br />\nbrown in colour and, due to the fact that they tend to grown outwards, they<br />\nhave a ‘stuck on’ appearance. This condition can be mistaken for malignant<br />\nmelanoma (especially when they are found on the face as flat lesions which<br />\nresemble lentigo maligna) and, if in doubt, warrant excision. Pyogenic<br />\ngranuloma (B) is a benign tumour which arises from cutaneous vasculature.<br />\nThese lesions tend to appear 1–2 weeks post trauma, commonly from rose<br />\nthorn injuries on the fingers. Epidermal naevi (D) are linear (often raised)<br />\nplaques that arise from localized benign proliferations of epidermal<br />\nkeratinocytes. Histiocytoma (E) is described as a benign firm, elevated yellow/<br />\nbrown (flesh coloured) nodule. Histiocytomas tend to appear on the lower leg<br />\narea and are known to rapidly enlarge. A dimple may develop in the middle<br />\nof the lesion (secondary to the lesion being squeezed) which is not seen in<br />\nmalignant melanomas..</p>"

                    "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Nope!</p><p>Correct answer is C : Bowen’s disease<br/>Bowen’s disease (C) is a form of intra-epidermal carcinoma in situ, which<br />\nmay, if untreated, but rarely, progresses to invasive squamous carcinoma. The<br />\ncondition presents as a solitary, scaling, erythematous plaque which usually<br />\nappears on the trunk. It is usually mistaken for a patch of psoriasis and is<br />\nfrequently treated as the latter. Seborrhoeic keratosis (A) is a condition of<br />\nunknown aetiology characterized by a benign proliferation of epidermal<br />\nkeratinocytes which do not progress to malignancy. Lesions are raised and<br />\nbrown in colour and, due to the fact that they tend to grown outwards, they<br />\nhave a ‘stuck on’ appearance. This condition can be mistaken for malignant<br />\nmelanoma (especially when they are found on the face as flat lesions which<br />\nresemble lentigo maligna) and, if in doubt, warrant excision. Pyogenic<br />\ngranuloma (B) is a benign tumour which arises from cutaneous vasculature.<br />\nThese lesions tend to appear 1–2 weeks post trauma, commonly from rose<br />\nthorn injuries on the fingers. Epidermal naevi (D) are linear (often raised)<br />\nplaques that arise from localized benign proliferations of epidermal<br />\nkeratinocytes. Histiocytoma (E) is described as a benign firm, elevated yellow/<br />\nbrown (flesh coloured) nodule. Histiocytomas tend to appear on the lower leg<br />\narea and are known to rapidly enlarge. A dimple may develop in the middle<br />\nof the lesion (secondary to the lesion being squeezed) which is not seen in<br />\nmalignant melanomas..</p>"

There is a high incidence of this condition in whiteskinned<br />\nindividuals coupled with a history of prolonged sun exposure (and<br />\nlong hours of strong sunshine). Lesions are commonly seen in the face (in<br />\nboth sexes), the back (common in males) and the leg (in females) and<br />\nglobally it affects men and women equally. The disease starts as a growing/<br />\nchanging area of brown/black coloured skin. In addition, a high index of<br />\nsuspicion is warranted in moles which are growing/changing with irregular<br />\nedges and varying pigmentation. The Glasgow 7 point checklist (major<br />\npoints: (1) size, (2) shape, (3) colour; minor points: (4) diameter >7 mm,<br />\n(5) inflammation, (6) oozing/bleeding, (7) itch/odd sensation) or the<br />\n‘ABCDE’ (Asymmeteric lesions, Border irregularity, Colour irregularity,<br />\nDiameter and Evolving) screening tool can be used to identify melanomas,<br />\nbut it is worth noting that not all melanomas have the above characteristics.<br />\nThe four main types of melanoma are superficial spreading (D) (which<br />\naccounts for 80 per cent of presenting melanomas), nodular melanoma<br />\n(A), lentigo maligna (B) and acral melanoma (C). Subungual melanoma (E)<br />\nis a variant of the acral type.

There is a high incidence of this condition in whiteskinned<br />\nindividuals coupled with a history of prolonged sun exposure (and<br />\nlong hours of strong sunshine). Lesions are commonly seen in the face (in<br />\nboth sexes), the back (common in males) and the leg (in females) and<br />\nglobally it affects men and women equally. The disease starts as a growing/<br />\nchanging area of brown/black coloured skin. In addition, a high index of<br />\nsuspicion is warranted in moles which are growing/changing with irregular<br />\nedges and varying pigmentation. The Glasgow 7 point checklist (major<br />\npoints: (1) size, (2) shape, (3) colour; minor points: (4) diameter >7 mm,<br />\n(5) inflammation, (6) oozing/bleeding, (7) itch/odd sensation) or the<br />\n‘ABCDE’ (Asymmeteric lesions, Border irregularity, Colour irregularity,<br />\nDiameter and Evolving) screening tool can be used to identify melanomas,<br />\nbut it is worth noting that not all melanomas have the above characteristics.<br />\nThe four main types of melanoma are superficial spreading (D) (which<br />\naccounts for 80 per cent of presenting melanomas), nodular melanoma<br />\n(A), lentigo maligna (B) and acral melanoma (C). Subungual melanoma (E)<br />\nis a variant of the acral type. If malignant melanoma is suspected, patients<br />\nare referred, without delay, for diagnostic excision biopsy with a narrow<br />\nmargin of 2–5 mm of normal skin..</p>"

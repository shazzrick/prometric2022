Wounds that indent the skin may cause underlying tendon or joint damage. Wounds that break the skin can be especially dangerous because of the variety and concentration of bacteria and viruses in saliva. Human bites have more than 50 types of bacteria. Such bites are thought to have a higher rate of infection than dog or cat bites. About one-third of all hand infections are caused by human bite injuries.<br />\n<br />\nWhat medicines are used to treat human bites?<br />\nThe doctor may prescribe oral (taken by mouth) or intravenous (through a vein) antibiotics in order to prevent or treat bacterial infections. These antibiotics include amoxicillin (such as Augmentin®). For adults who are allergic to penicillin, doctors may prescribe clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethotrexate or ciprofloxacin (Cipro®).

It affects women more than men. The onset usually occurs over a period of months and may include systemic features such as lethargy and weight loss. The proximal muscles of the shoulder and pelvis girdle become weak and wasted. The disease may then progress to involve the pharyngeal, laryngeal or respiratory muscles. When features of polymyositis are accompanied with overlying skin changes, it is termed ‘dermatomyositis’ (A). These include a heliotrope (lilac) rash over the eyelids, scaly red papules over the knuckles, elbows or knees (Gottron’s papules), a macular rash over the back and shoulders (shawl sign) or painful cracking over the tips of the fingers (mechanic’s hands). The absence of these features makes dermatomyositis the incorrect answer. Polymyalgia rheumatica (C) may affect the proximal muscles. However, it is associated with pain, which is an uncommon feature of polymyositis. Although investigations have not been mentioned in this question, it is worth noting that polymyalgia rheumatica is associated with a raised ESR while in polymyositis, the ESR is usually not raised. Kawasaki’s disease (D) is a medium-vessel vasculitis that affects mainly children and does not cause proximal muscle weakness, making this answer incorrect.

It is also more common in people of Afro- Carribean origin and peak age of onset is usually 20–40 years of age. Multiple genetic and aetiological factors have been associated with the development of this disease. SLE has an extremely variable presentation, with clinical features usually caused by underlying vasculitis. These include polarthritis (the most common clinical feature, often a symmetrical small joint polyarthritis similar to that seen in early RA), photosensitive rashes (characteristic erythematous rash over malar eminences, sparing the nasolabial folds), mouth ulcers, serositis (affecting pleura or pericardium) or renal disease (usually nephrotic syndrome of renal failure due to underlying glomerulonephritis). The features presented in this case are, therefore, most suggestive of SLE (A) as the diagnosis. The raised ESR and CRP should also identify SLE as the correct answer. Systemic sclerosis (B) can be localized or diffuse and does not characteristically cause mouth ulcers, pleural effusions or a raised ESR. Sjögren’s (C) is a syndrome of dry eyes and dry mouth. It can be a primary syndrome or occur secondary to other autoimmune diseases. While it is associated with athralgia, the pleural effusion, mouth ulcers and blood results make this diagnosis unikely.

Pulmonary fibrosis is also a side effect of methotrexate, a disease-modifiying anti-rheumatic drug, which is commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis. Pulmonary oedema (A) will cause shortness of breath and be heard as fine inspiratory crackles during respiratory examination. However, it would characteristically produce a productive cough of frothy sputum. In addition, pulmonary oedema is not an extra-articular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis or a side effect of the drugs used to treat it, making this answer incorrect. Consolidation (B) occurs as a result of an infective process and can present in a number of ways including shortness of breath, productive cough or pleurisy. On respiratory examination, there is likely to be bronchial breathing and end expiratory crackles. Pleural effusions (C) are an extraarticular manifestation in rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical features would include shortness of breath and, on examination, there would be reduced air entry, stony dullness to percussion and reduced vocal resonance.

Clinical manifestations include a lower limb purpuric rash, arthritis (most commonly involving the ankles, knees or elbows) and abdominal pain. Haematuria may occur due to underlying glomerulonephritis. Perthes disease (B) is characterized by avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis. A purpuric rash and haematuria are not features, making this answer incorrect. Similarly, while oral and genital ulceration are features in Beçhet’s disease, (C) purpuric rash and haematuria are not seen. Similarly, purpuric rash and haematuria are not features of Still’s disease (D), making this answer incorrect. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (E) is a hypermobility syndrome caused by a defect in collagen.

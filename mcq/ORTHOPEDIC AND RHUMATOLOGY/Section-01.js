There is nothing specific on joint aspiration to determine a diagnosis of RA.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nRheumatoid arthritis presents most often in women > 50. Patients have joint pain and morning stiffness that is symmetrical and in multiple joints of the hands lasting for more than 1 hour in the morning with the symptomatic episode going on for at least 6 weeks. There is often a prodrome of malaise and weight loss, but this is not enough to make a clear diagnosis.<br />\nRA is defined as having 4 or more of the following present for diagnosis:<br />\n<br />\n-Morning stiffness lasting more than 1 hour <br />\n-Positive rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP C-reactive protein <br />\n-(CRP) or ESR <br />\n-Inflammatory arthritis of 3 or more joints—the more joints involved, the more likely the diagnosis. The proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints are frequently involved. <br />\n-Duration of symptoms: more than 6 weeks.</p>"

It primarily affects the axial joints, most notably the sacroiliac joints. Other sites of involvement include the spine, peripheral joints, and entheses (capsules, ligaments, and tendons). Inflammatory enthesopathy progressing to ossification and ankylosis is the pathologic basis for the disease. Extra-articular manifestations vary widely in terms of both frequency and severity. The most common extra-articular manifestations are represented by uveitis, bowel disease, heart, lung, skin, bone and kidney involvement.

It primarily affects the axial joints, most notably the sacroiliac joints. Other sites of involvement include the spine, peripheral joints, and entheses (capsules, ligaments, and tendons). Inflammatory enthesopathy progressing to ossification and ankylosis is the pathologic basis for the disease. Extra-articular manifestations vary widely in terms of both frequency and severity. The most common extra-articular manifestations are represented by uveitis, bowel disease, heart, lung, skin, bone and kidney involvement. This review focuses on prevalence and clinical characteristics of the most common extra-articular manifestations in AS.</p>"

Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis) and stops growing. Over time, healing occurs by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and a weakening of the femoral head. <br />\nThe condition is most commonly found in children between the ages of 4 and 8, but it can occur in children between the ages of 2 and 15. It can produce a permanent deformity of the femoral head, which increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis in adults. Perthes is a form of osteochondritis which only affects the hip. Bilateral Perthes, which means both hips are affected, should always be investigated to rule out multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.<br />\n<br />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legg–Calvé–Perthes_disease<br />\n\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legg–Calvé–Perthes_disease<br />\n</a>.</p>"

Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis) and stops growing. Over time, healing occurs by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and a weakening of the femoral head. <br />\nThe condition is most commonly found in children between the ages of 4 and 8, but it can occur in children between the ages of 2 and 15. It can produce a permanent deformity of the femoral head, which increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis in adults. Perthes is a form of osteochondritis which only affects the hip. Bilateral Perthes, which means both hips are affected, should always be investigated to rule out multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.<br />\n<br />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legg–Calvé–Perthes_disease<br />\n\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legg–Calvé–Perthes_disease<br />\n</a>.</p>"

There are specific types of traumatic injuries that are virtually pathognomonic of child abuse and can not be explained by accidental trauma (choice A). Metaphyseal fractures are the most typical (although not the most frequent) injuries due to physical abuse. They are produced by pulling and twisting the limbs, which results in traction on the metaphyses transmitted by the joint ligaments. Other skeletal injuries that should suggest abuse include multiple fract ures of different ages, and fractures of posterior ribs, scapula, spinous processes, and sternum. The following is a list of injury patterns typically associated with child abuse:<br />\nBruises on the buttocks, abdominal wall, genitalia, back, and dorsal hands and<br />\nfeet. Accidental bruises in the active toddler are usually on bony<br />\nprominences.Head injuries: subdural hematoma, diffuse axonal injury, and retinal<br />\npetechiae.Abdominal injuries: intestinal rupture or hematoma occurs more<br />\nfrequently than injuries to solid organs from a hard blow.Burns: cigarette burns and<br />\nburns of the buttock area due to scalding water.<br />\nOsteogenesis imperfecta (choice B) refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders due to inherited deficiencies in synthesis of type I collagen. This condition results in skeletal fragility and numerous fractures starting in utero or early life.<br />\nOsteopetrosis (choice C) is a hereditary disease caused by dysfunction in osteoclasts.The bone acquires a stone-like consistency but is also very brittle. Fractures, hydrocephalus, and anemia manifest soon after birth. On x-rays, absence of medullary cavity, sclerosis of bone, and misshapen distal ends of long bones are diagnostic features.<br />\nRickets (choice E) results from deficiency of vitamin D, which is infrequent in<br />\nindustrialized countries.

SLE gives joint pain without deformation or erosion. That is why the x-ray is normal. </p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">Diagnostic Tests</strong> ANA: found in 95% to 99% of cases. A negative ANA is extremely sensitive for lupus, but a positive ANA has little specificity. Many rheumatologic diseases are associated with a positive ANA. Anti-double-stranded (DS) DNA (60%) and anti-Sm (30%): These are found only in SLE. They are extremely specific for SLE. Decreased complement levels: They can correlate with disease activity. They can drop further with acute disease exacerbations. Anti-SSA (anti-Ro) and anti-SSB (anti-La): Found in 10% to 20% of cases. They add little to the diagnosis if the DNA is positive. These tests are most often found in Sjögren syndrome (65% of cases). A finding of anti-SSA or anti-Ro in the mother’s blood predicts who is at risk of passing on neonatal SLE. If the mother is anti-Ro positive, answer “Check baby EKG” or “Baby at risk of heart block.” Treatment Acute lupus flare is treated with high-dose boluses of steroids. Hydroxychloroquine can control mildly chronic disease limited to skin and joint manifestations. Belimumab controls progression of the disease. Lupus nephritis may need steroids either alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate. The only way to determine the severity of lupus nephritis is with a kidney biopsy. The urinalysis is insufficient to tell the severity of lupus nephritis. Biopsy is the only way to tell if there is simple glomerulosclerosis, or scarring of the kidney, which will not respond to therapy. </p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\">Tips-Do not treat an asymptomatic ANA.</strong> -Young patients most commonly die of infection.

The only sure way to confirm a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis is to remove a small piece of tissue from an affected organ (biopsy) and examine it under a microscope. Your doctor may remove tissue from your nasal passages, airways or lungs to confirm or rule out the presence of both vasculitis and granulomas. Other areas for biopsy may include your skin or your kidneys. Some biopsies can be performed in an outpatient setting using a numbing medication (local anesthetic). Others, such as an open-lung biopsy, may require hospitalization.http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wegeners-granulomatosis/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20028113.</p>"

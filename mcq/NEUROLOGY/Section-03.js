This results in ipsilateral paralysis and loss of light touch and vibration sensation and contralateral loss in pain and temperature below the point of the lesion. The spinothalamic tracts cross at the level of the cord, so sensation to pain and temperature is lost in the contralateral limbs (B). C3, 4, 5 keep the diaphragm alive (A), so breathing should be preserved. As the right corticospinal tract has been severed, the right, ipsilateral hand would be paralysed (C) as well as the right leg. The left dorsal columns carry light touch fibres from the left limb (D). They have been unaffected by the injury. C6 is responsible for the biceps reflex and would be lost (E).

Perfusion is restored after the patient collapses and unconsciousness lasts no more than seconds or a couple of minutes with full recovery. However, vasovagal epsiodes (A) can be brought on by sleep or food deprivation, hot or emotional environments, Valsalva manoeuvre (such as straining) and are not as closely related to position.

This is not a normal response (E). This is called a relative afferent<br />\npupillary defect (RAPD) (C). It is relative to the other eye, and afferent<br />\nbecause CN II (the optic nerve) is the afferent limb (A) of the reflex. The<br />\nefferent limb (B and D) is CN III which is intact (see Figure 8.2)..</p>"

This means that<br />\nthere is a problem in the communication between CN VI (abducens) of the<br />\nright eye and CN III (occulomotor) of the left eye. Normally these nuclei<br />\ncommunicate via the medial longitudinal fasciculus in order to maintain<br />\nconjugate gaze. This keeps the eyes aligned on the same spot. If they are not<br />\naligned, double vision occurs. In this patient’s case, there is a lesion in the<br />\nmedial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). To look right, she abducts her right<br />\neye, but as the MLF is affected, she is unable to direct the left eye to adduct<br />\nto maintain conjugate gaze. This results in diplopia. The right eye which has<br />\nabducted fully develops compensatory nystagmus as the left eye has failed<br />\nto adduct. Note that the problem is not in the oculomotor nerve or medial<br />\nrectus. The vestibulo-occular reflex would be intact, i.e. if the patient were<br />\nto keep her eyes fixed on a target and move her head left, her left eye would<br />\nadduct normally. Multiple sclerosis (D) is a common cause of INO. MG (A)<br />\noften results in ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of one or more extraocular<br />\nmuscle), but this affects the neuromuscular junction, not the MLF. Cerebellar<br />\nsyndromes (C) would result in nystagmus but not ophthalmoplegia.<br />\nPeripheral neuropathies (E) are not directly associated with opthalmoplegia<br />\nor nystagmus. Vertigo (B) is a symptom, not a diagnosis. It is the illusion of<br />\nmovement (i.e. a subjective sensation of movement where there is none). It<br />\nis best elicited by asking the patient if they see the room moving. This<br />\nclearly differentiates it from the vague report of ‘dizziness’ (see Figure 8.3)..</p>"

The right eye which has<br />\nabducted fully develops compensatory nystagmus as the left eye has failed<br />\nto adduct. Note that the problem is not in the oculomotor nerve or medial<br />\nrectus. The vestibulo-occular reflex would be intact, i.e. if the patient were<br />\nto keep her eyes fixed on a target and move her head left, her left eye would<br />\nadduct normally. Multiple sclerosis (D) is a common cause of INO. MG (A)<br />\noften results in ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of one or more extraocular<br />\nmuscle), but this affects the neuromuscular junction, not the MLF. Cerebellar<br />\nsyndromes (C) would result in nystagmus but not ophthalmoplegia.<br />\nPeripheral neuropathies (E) are not directly associated with opthalmoplegia<br />\nor nystagmus. Vertigo (B) is a symptom, not a diagnosis. It is the illusion of<br />\nmovement (i.e. a subjective sensation of movement where there is none). It<br />\nis best elicited by asking the patient if they see the room moving. This<br />\nclearly differentiates it from the vague report of ‘dizziness’ (see Figure 8.3)..</p>"

                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Correct!</p><p>Correct answer is A : Hemiplegic<br/>This patient has a hemiplegic gait (A). There is asymmetrical weakness<br />\ninvolving the right upper and lower limb. His flexors are stronger than his<br />\nextensors in the upper limb while the extensors are stronger than the<br />\nflexors in the lower limb. This may be complicated by increased tone<br />\n(spasticity) and, if longstanding, contractures. This is a typical pyramidal<br />\n(or UMN) pattern. As a result, the patient circumducts his leg in order to<br />\nwalk as he cannot flex his hip properly to take a step. Technically, this<br />\nshould be termed ‘hemiparetic’ rather than ‘hemiplegic’ gait, as paresis<br />\nrefers to weakness while plegia implies paralysis. If there were complete<br />\nparalysis, they would not be able to walk. Hemiparesis is typically as a<br />\nresult of contralateral hemispheric lesions, e.g. stroke, tumour or abscess.<br />\nUMN lesions result in spasticity (D), but this particular gait is best<br />\ndescribed as hemiplegic. Bilateral lower limb spasticity, seen in cerebral<br />\npalsy and cord lesions (multiple sclerosis), results in scissoring (B). The<br />\nlegs are stiff and the adductors are stronger than abductors, resulting in<br />\nthe legs crossing over with each step. High stepping gaits (C) are seen in<br />\nfoot drop as the patient is unable to dorsiflex the ankle so must lift their<br />\nknee high to avoid their foot dragging on the ground. Stomping gaits (E)<br />\nare seen in patients with sensory peripheral neuropathy, e.g. diabetics. By<br />\nbanging their foot down, vibrations travel up the leg where they can be<br />\ndetected by intact nerves, returning their joint position sense..</p>"

                  "__cdata": "<p class=\"p_20 black\">Nope!</p><p>Correct answer is A : Hemiplegic<br/>This patient has a hemiplegic gait (A). There is asymmetrical weakness<br />\ninvolving the right upper and lower limb. His flexors are stronger than his<br />\nextensors in the upper limb while the extensors are stronger than the<br />\nflexors in the lower limb. This may be complicated by increased tone<br />\n(spasticity) and, if longstanding, contractures. This is a typical pyramidal<br />\n(or UMN) pattern. As a result, the patient circumducts his leg in order to<br />\nwalk as he cannot flex his hip properly to take a step. Technically, this<br />\nshould be termed ‘hemiparetic’ rather than ‘hemiplegic’ gait, as paresis<br />\nrefers to weakness while plegia implies paralysis. If there were complete<br />\nparalysis, they would not be able to walk. Hemiparesis is typically as a<br />\nresult of contralateral hemispheric lesions, e.g. stroke, tumour or abscess.<br />\nUMN lesions result in spasticity (D), but this particular gait is best<br />\ndescribed as hemiplegic. Bilateral lower limb spasticity, seen in cerebral<br />\npalsy and cord lesions (multiple sclerosis), results in scissoring (B). The<br />\nlegs are stiff and the adductors are stronger than abductors, resulting in<br />\nthe legs crossing over with each step. High stepping gaits (C) are seen in<br />\nfoot drop as the patient is unable to dorsiflex the ankle so must lift their<br />\nknee high to avoid their foot dragging on the ground. Stomping gaits (E)<br />\nare seen in patients with sensory peripheral neuropathy, e.g. diabetics. By<br />\nbanging their foot down, vibrations travel up the leg where they can be<br />\ndetected by intact nerves, returning their joint position sense..</p>"

These most<br />\ncommonly occur as a result of trauma and rupture of the middle meningeal<br />\nartery. Crescent-shaped haematomas (C) indicate the blood is between the<br />\ndura and arachnoid. Subdural haemorrhages occur as a result of bleeding<br />\nfrom bridging veins, more commonly seen in the elderly and alcoholics<br />\nas the veins are stretched from cerebral atrophy. Blood along the sulci<br />\nand fissure (D) indicates that it is located between the arachnoid and the<br />\npia. Subarachnoid haemorrhages present clinically as a thunderclap<br />\nheadache which may be associated with reduced GCS and seizures. All<br />\nintracranial haemorrhages require discussion with a neurosurgeon in case<br />\nsurgical evacuation of the clot is indicated (although it often is not).<br />\nSigns that point to increased severity of bleed include midline shift (B),<br />\nwhich indicates increased intracranial pressure, and intraventricular<br />\nbleeding (E)..</p>"

These most<br />\ncommonly occur as a result of trauma and rupture of the middle meningeal<br />\nartery. Crescent-shaped haematomas (C) indicate the blood is between the<br />\ndura and arachnoid. Subdural haemorrhages occur as a result of bleeding<br />\nfrom bridging veins, more commonly seen in the elderly and alcoholics<br />\nas the veins are stretched from cerebral atrophy. Blood along the sulci<br />\nand fissure (D) indicates that it is located between the arachnoid and the<br />\npia. Subarachnoid haemorrhages present clinically as a thunderclap<br />\nheadache which may be associated with reduced GCS and seizures. All<br />\nintracranial haemorrhages require discussion with a neurosurgeon in case<br />\nsurgical evacuation of the clot is indicated (although it often is not).<br />\nSigns that point to increased severity of bleed include midline shift (B),<br />\nwhich indicates increased intracranial pressure, and intraventricular<br />\nbleeding (E)..</p>"

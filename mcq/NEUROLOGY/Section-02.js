This relatively high dose is usually maintained for 3 to 4 weeks, following which the dose is gradually reduced over many weeks to months, watching for reemergence of clinical symptoms (headache, jaw claudication, etc.) or rising erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Sometimes side effects require that the dose be reduced earlier than 4 weeks, but this must be individualized to suit each patient's special needs. Patients with polymyalgia rheumatica but no headache or other specific signs of temporal arteritis can be safely managed with 15 mg/day or less prednisone from the outset and seem not to be liable to get ischemic complications. If headache or other signs of temporal arteritis emerge during the course of polymyalgia rheumatica, however, it is important to increase the prednisone dosage to the levels recommended for initial treatment of temporal arteritis. http://www.medmerits.com/index.php/article/temporal_arteritis/P10.</p>"

The first step is to stop the antipsychotic medication and treat the hyperthermia aggressively, such as with cooling blankets or ice packs to the axillae and groin. Supportive care in an intensive care unit capable of circulatory and ventilatory support is crucial. The best pharmacological treatment is still unclear. Dantrolene has been used when needed to reduce muscle rigidity, and more recently dopamine pathway medications such as bromocriptine have shown benefit. Amantadine is another treatment option due to its dopaminergic and anticholinergic effects. Apomorphine may be used however its use is supported by little evidence.Benzodiazepines may be used to control agitation. Highly elevated blood myoglobin levels can result in kidney damage, therefore aggressive intravenous hydration with diuresis may be required. When recognized early NMS can be successfully managed; however, up to 10% of cases can be fatal.<br />\nShould a patient subsequently require an antipsychotic, trialling a low dose of a low-potency atypical antipsychotic is recommended<br />\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroleptic_malignant_syndrome.</p>"

It occurs in 1 to 4 per 10,000 people per year.[2] About 1.5% of people are affected at some point in their life.[7] It most commonly occurs in people between ages 15 and 60.[1] Males and females are affected equally.[1] It is named after Scottish surgeon Charles Bell (1774–1842), who first described the connection of the facial nerve to the condition.</p>"

It occurs in 1 to 4 per 10,000 people per year.[2] About 1.5% of people are affected at some point in their life.[7] It most commonly occurs in people between ages 15 and 60.[1] Males and females are affected equally.[1] It is named after Scottish surgeon Charles Bell (1774–1842), who first described the connection of the facial nerve to the condition.</p>"

Extrapyramidal disorders may produce either an abnormal decrease of muscle tone (Hypotonia )or an abnormal increase (rigidity).In like fashion they may bring about either an overall paucity of movement (hypokinesia ) or superfluous movement of various types , including tremor , chorea , athetosis, and other involuntary movement.<br />\nIntention tremor results from a lesion affecting the superior cerebellar peduncle. Because it is often very coarse, it can lead to severe functional disability. No satisfactory medical treatment exists, but stereotactic surgery of the contralateral ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus or high-frequency thalamic stimulation through an implanted device is sometimes helpful when patients are severely incapacitated.Intention tremor can also occur—together with other signs of cerebellar involvement—as a manifestation of toxicity of certain sedative or anticonvulsant drugs (eg, phenytoin) or alcohol; it is seen in patients with Wilson disease..</p>"

Weakness or paralysis<br />\nWasting and fasciculations of involved muscles<br />\nHypotonia (flaccidity)<br />\nLoss of tendon reflexes when neurons subserving them are affected<br />\nNormal abdominal and plantar reflexes—unless the neurons subserving them are directly involved, in which case reflex responses are lost.<br />\nAns-A……………….The extra pyramidal system,like the cerebellum,plays an important role in motor function. It enables rapid and harmonious execution of movement and optimal performance of complex motor sequences. Extrapyramidal disorders may produce either an abnormal decrease of muscle tone (Hypotonia )or an abnormal increase (rigidity).In like fashion they may bring about either an overall paucity of movement (hypokinesia ) or superfluous movement of various types , including tremor , chorea , athetosis, and other involuntary movement.<br />\nIntention tremor results from a lesion affecting the superior cerebellar peduncle. Because it is often very coarse, it can lead to severe functional disability. No satisfactory medical treatment exists, but stereotactic surgery of the contralateral ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus or high-frequency thalamic stimulation through an implanted device is sometimes helpful when patients are severely incapacitated.Intention tremor can also occur—together with other signs of cerebellar involvement—as a manifestation of toxicity of certain sedative or anticonvulsant drugs (eg, phenytoin) or alcohol; it is seen in patients with Wilson disease..</p>"

The condition is part of a larger group of thiamine deficiency disorders, that includes beriberi in all its forms, and alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome. When it occurs simultaneously with alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome it is known as Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome.[2][3] <br />\nClassically, Wernicke encephalopathy is characterised by the triad – ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion. Around 10% of patients exhibit all three features, and other symptoms may also be present.[4] While it is commonly regarded as a condition peculiar to malnourished people with alcohol misuse, it can be caused by a variety of diseases.[2][5] It is treated with thiamine supplementation, which can lead to improvement of the symptoms and often complete resolution, particularly in those where alcohol misuse is not the underlying cause.[citation needed] Often other nutrients also need to be replaced, depending on the cause. <br />\nWernicke encephalopathy may be present in the general population with a prevalence of around 2%, and is considered underdiagnosed; probably, many cases are in patients who do not have commonly-associated symptoms..</p>"
